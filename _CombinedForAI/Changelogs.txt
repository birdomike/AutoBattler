# AutoBattler Game - Status Effect Icon System Improvements (v0.4.3)

This version focuses on fixing critical issues with the status effect icon system and tooltip persistence.

## Status Effect Icons Path Fix

### Problem
- Status effect icons were saved in a nested folder (`assets\images\icons\status\status-icons\`), but the code was looking in the parent folder.
- Icon filenames weren't properly matched with the status effect IDs in the code.

### Implementation
- Updated the icon path in `BattleManager.js` to include the "status-icons" subfolder:
  ```javascript
  // Previous code (incorrect path)
  icon.style.backgroundImage = `url(assets/images/icons/status/${statusId.replace('status_', '')}.png)`;
  
  // New code (correct path)
  const iconId = statusId.replace('status_', '');
  const iconPath = `assets/images/icons/status/status-icons/${iconId}.png`;
  ```

- Added proper error handling with image preloading:
  ```javascript
  // Create an image object to check if the icon exists
  const img = new Image();
  img.onload = () => {
      // Icon loaded successfully, set it as background
      icon.style.backgroundImage = `url(${iconPath})`;
      icon.innerHTML = ''; // Clear any inner HTML/text
  };
  img.onerror = () => {
      // Icon failed to load, use emoji fallback
      console.warn(`Could not load icon for ${statusId}`);
  };
  img.src = iconPath;
  ```

## Tooltip Persistence Fix

### Problem
- Status effect tooltips were not showing after a new battle started.
- Tooltip handlers weren't being properly removed when a battle ended.
- New tooltip handlers weren't being attached when a new battle started.

### Implementation
- Added a comprehensive cleanup method in `BattleUI.js`:
  ```javascript
  cleanupTooltips() {
      // Remove all existing tooltip event listeners
      const tooltipElements = document.querySelectorAll('.status-icon');
      tooltipElements.forEach(el => {
          // Clone element to remove all event listeners
          const newEl = el.cloneNode(true);
          if (el.parentNode) {
              el.parentNode.replaceChild(newEl, el);
          }
      });
      
      // Clear any existing tooltip containers
      const tooltipContainers = document.querySelectorAll('.battle-tooltip');
      tooltipContainers.forEach(container => {
          if (container.parentNode) {
              container.parentNode.removeChild(container);
          }
      });
      
      // Reset the battleTooltip property
      this.battleTooltip = null;
  }
  ```

- Ensured the cleanup method is called at strategic points:
  1. When initializing the tooltip manager
  2. When BattleUI is initialized (even if already set up)
  3. Before removing an existing UI

## Enhanced Status Icon Styling

### Improvements
- Updated CSS for status icons to enhance visibility and interaction:
  ```css
  .status-icon {
      /* Base styling */
      width: 16px;
      height: 16px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      font-size: 10px;
      text-align: center;
      
      /* Enhanced styling */
      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Default background */
      border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); /* Light border */
      overflow: hidden; /* Keep circular shape */
      background-size: cover; /* For icon images */
      background-position: center;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      
      /* Improved hover effect */
      transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s;
  }
  
  .status-icon:hover {
      transform: scale(1.3); /* Larger scale */
      box-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); /* Glow effect */
      z-index: 10; /* Appear above other icons */
  }
  ```

## Testing Notes

The changes were thoroughly tested to ensure:
1. Status effect icons now load correctly from the correct folder.
2. Tooltips properly persist when starting new battles.
3. Icon display is visually improved and consistent across the UI.
4. Fallback to emoji icons works when image loading fails.

These improvements make the status effect system more robust and visually appealing, enhancing the overall game experience.

# CHANGELOG 0.4.5 - Passive Ability System Fixes

## Overview
This update focuses on fixing critical issues in the passive ability system that were causing battle disruptions, including infinite loops, NaN health values, and confusion between characters with the same name on different teams.

## Primary Issues Addressed

### 1. Infinite Damage Reflection Loop
**Problem**: When two characters both had the Damage Reflection passive ability, they would enter an infinite loop of reflecting damage back and forth, causing the battle to stall.

**Root Cause**: 
- No limit on how many times a passive ability could trigger per turn
- No validation to prevent reflections from triggering other reflections
- No team validation to avoid triggering reflection on allies

**Solution**:
- Implemented tracking system to record which passive abilities have triggered in a turn
- Added strict validation in the `passive_DamageReflectOnHit` function to prevent friendly fire
- Added proper damage amount validation to prevent reflections below a minimum threshold

### 2. Passive Abilities Used as Active Abilities
**Problem**: Passive abilities like "Natural Healing" were incorrectly being selected as active abilities during combat.

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient filtering in `generateCharacterAction` to exclude passive abilities
- Simple check for `abilityType !== 'Passive'` was not handling all cases

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the filtering in `generateCharacterAction` to properly exclude all passive abilities
- Added multiple checks to catch passive abilities, including:
  - Check for explicit `abilityType === 'Passive'` flag
  - Check for passive-specific properties like `passiveTrigger` and `passiveBehavior`
  - Added debugging logs to show available active abilities

### 3. NaN Health Values
**Problem**: Characters' health would sometimes become NaN, corrupting all future calculations.

**Root Cause**:
- Unvalidated inputs in damage calculations
- Reflection amount calculations not accounting for edge cases

**Solution**:
- Implemented a comprehensive `applyDamage` method with thorough input validation
- Added health value recovery mechanism for invalid health values
- Added strict type checking for damage amounts
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging

### 4. Team Identification and Confusion
**Problem**: Characters with the same name on different teams caused targeting confusion and incorrect healing application.

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient uniqueness in character identification
- Team information not properly preserved in all contexts

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `prepareTeamForBattle` to create more robust uniqueIds
- Included team type in the uniqueId to prevent confusion between characters with the same name
- Fixed team assignment logic to be more reliable
- Added clearer team identifiers in battle log messages

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Classes and Methods
- Added `applyDamage` method to BattleManager.js with comprehensive validation
- Added tracking system for passive abilities triggered in a turn

### Updated Files
1. **BattleManager.js**:
   - Enhanced `generateCharacterAction` to better filter passive abilities
   - Added tracking for passive abilities triggered within a turn
   - Improved `prepareTeamForBattle` for better character uniqueness
   - Added robust `applyDamage` method with input validation

2. **PassiveBehaviors.js**:
   - Enhanced `passive_DamageReflectOnHit` with better validation
   - Added team checking to prevent friendly fire
   - Added stricter damage amount validation

### Validation Improvements
- Added strict type checking for all damage and healing operations
- Enhanced health value validation and recovery
- Added team relationship validation to prevent incorrect targeting
- Implemented passive trigger tracking to prevent multiple triggers

## Testing Notes
The fixes were verified by running battles with characters having reflection passives (like Vaelgor) on both teams. The key validation points were:

1. No infinite reflection loops occur between characters
2. All characters maintain valid health values throughout combat
3. Passive abilities are never used as active abilities
4. Characters with the same name on different teams are treated as separate entities
5. All battle log messages clearly indicate team affiliations

## Known Limitations
- The passive trigger tracking resets each turn, so the same passive can trigger again in subsequent turns
- Team identification still relies on 'player' and 'enemy' designations rather than numerical team IDs


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.4.4.6.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.4.4.6 - Battle Logic & Passive Ability Improvements

## Overview
This update focuses on reinforcing the battle logic system, particularly addressing issues with passive abilities, damage reflection, and healing targeting. The changes ensure better stability during battles and prevent infinite loops or incorrect targeting.

## Primary Issues Addressed

### 1. Infinite Damage Reflection Loops
**Problem**: Characters with Damage Reflection passive abilities (like Vaelgor) could enter infinite reflection chains when facing other characters with the same passive, causing battles to stall.

**Root Cause**: 
- No limit on how many times damage could be reflected
- No minimum threshold for reflection (tiny amounts kept being reflected)
- No tracking of reflection depth in the damage chain

**Solution**:
- Implemented a reflection depth tracking system with a maximum of 2 reflections
- Added a minimum reflection threshold (damages â‰¤2 won't reflect if it's already a secondary reflection)
- Enhanced the reflection passive to check depth and avoid excessive chains
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose reflection issues

### 2. Incorrect Healing Ability Targeting
**Problem**: Healing abilities sometimes targeted enemies instead of allies due to defaulting to the same targeting logic as damage abilities.

**Root Cause**:
- No special targeting behavior for healing abilities
- Default targeting behavior favored enemies

**Solution**:
- Added special targeting logic detection for healing abilities
- Force ally targeting for abilities with `isHealing: true` or `damageType: 'healing'`
- Defaulted healing abilities to target lowest HP ally when no explicit targeting logic is specified
- Added debug logging for targeting decisions

### 3. Excessive Passive Ability Triggers
**Problem**: Some passive abilities could trigger multiple times at battle start or during other events, causing unintended effects.

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient tracking of which passives had already triggered
- No battle-level passive trigger tracking (only turn-level)

**Solution**:
- Added battle-level passive trigger tracking using a Map structure
- Ensured proper initialization of tracking objects
- Added checks to prevent duplicate triggers for the same event

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Reflection Depth Control System
The reflection depth control system was implemented in PassiveBehaviors.js:

```javascript
function passive_DamageReflectOnHit(context) {
    // Extract reflection depth from context
    const { reflectionDepth = 0 } = additionalData;
    
    // Prevent excessive reflection chains
    if (reflectionDepth >= 2) {
        console.debug(`Max reflection depth (${reflectionDepth}) reached, stopping reflection chain`);
        return { executed: false };
    }
    
    // Calculate reflected damage
    const reflectAmount = Math.round(Math.max(1, damageAmount * 0.2));
    
    // Skip small reflections for secondary reflections to prevent endless chains
    if (reflectAmount <= 2 && reflectionDepth > 0) {
        console.debug(`Reflection amount (${reflectAmount}) too small for secondary reflection, stopping chain`);
        return { executed: false };
    }
    
    // Apply reflected damage with depth tracking
    battleManager.applyDamage(
        source,                  
        reflectAmount,          
        actor,                  
        null,                   
        'reflected',            
        { reflectionDepth: reflectionDepth + 1 }
    );
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Targeting for Healing
The targeted healing system ensures healing abilities always target allies:

```javascript
// Use appropriate targeting behavior based on ability type
const isHealing = selectedAbility.isHealing || selectedAbility.damageType === 'healing';

// Force ally targeting for healing abilities
let effectiveTargetingLogic = targetingLogic;
if (isHealing && !effectiveTargetingLogic) {
    // Healing abilities should target allies by default
    effectiveTargetingLogic = 'targetLowestHpAlly';
    console.debug(`Forcing ally targeting for healing ability: ${selectedAbility.name}`);
}
```

### 3. Battle-Level Passive Trigger Tracking
A new battle-level tracking system was implemented to ensure passive abilities trigger appropriately:

```javascript
// Initialize passive trigger tracking at battle level
this.passiveTriggersThisBattle = new Map();

// In processPassiveAbilities:
if (!this.passiveTriggersThisBattle) {
    this.passiveTriggersThisBattle = new Map();
}

// And later in the processing loop:
const passiveId = `${character.uniqueId}_${passiveAbility.name}_${trigger}`;
const passiveTriggerKey = trigger === 'onBattleStart' ? passiveId : null;

// For battle start events, check if already triggered
if (passiveTriggerKey && this.passiveTriggersThisBattle.has(passiveTriggerKey)) {
    console.debug(`Skipping duplicate battle-level passive trigger: ${passiveId}`);
    continue;
}

// Mark as triggered at battle level if needed
if (passiveTriggerKey) {
    this.passiveTriggersThisBattle.set(passiveTriggerKey, true);
}
```

## Testing Notes
The fixes were verified with specific test scenarios:

1. Battle with multiple reflection characters (Vaelgor vs Vaelgor)
2. Testing healing abilities to ensure they target allies
3. Checking battle start passives to ensure they only trigger once
4. Verifying reflection chains stop at maximum depth limit

## Known Limitations
- Battle-level tracking resets between battles
- The 2-reflection maximum is hard-coded but could be made configurable in the future
- The minimum reflection threshold (2) could be tuned further based on balance testing

1. **passive_OnKillEffect**: Triggers various effects when a character kills an enemy
   - Supports healing, buffs, or AoE damage effects
   - Configurable through `passiveData` with options for effect type, value, and duration
   - Example implementation on the new Riven character's "Bloodthirst" passive

2. **passive_CriticalHitBoost**: Increases critical hit chance after specific triggers
   - Configurable triggers (e.g., after dealing significant damage)
   - Customizable duration and bonus amount via `passiveData`
   - Includes validation for trigger conditions (damage threshold)

3. **passive_StatusOnHit**: Chance to apply status effects when hitting enemies
   - Configurable status type, chance, and duration
   - Provides appropriate feedback messages
   - Implements randomized chance mechanics

### 2. Passive Ability Visual Feedback
Added a new `showPassiveEffect` method to `BattleUI.js` that provides visual feedback when passive abilities trigger:

- Custom animation styles for passive effects
- Improved user experience by making passive triggers more visible

Implementation details:
```javascript
showPassiveEffect(character, effectName) {
    // Display visual effect above character
    const passiveEffect = document.createElement('div');
    passiveEffect.className = 'passive-effect';
    passiveEffect.textContent = 'âœ¨ ' + effectName;
    
    // Add glow effect to character
    const glowEffect = document.createElement('div');
    glowEffect.className = 'passive-glow';
    glowEffect.style.boxShadow = '0 0 15px 5px rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.6)';
    glowEffect.style.animation = 'passive-glow 1s ease-out';
    
    // Custom animation keyframes
    // @keyframes passive-glow {...}
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Trigger Points in BattleManager
Modified the `BattleManager.js` to include additional data and visual feedback for passive triggers:

1. **Added percentage calculations**:
   - Damage percentage relative to target's max HP
   - Healing percentage relative to target's max HP
   - Provides context for threshold-based passive abilities

2. **Enhanced kill effect handling**:

# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10 - UI Mode Separation & Team Data Fix

## Overview
This update focuses on two critical foundation issues:
1. Separating the DOM-based UI and Phaser-based UI to ensure only one UI system is active at a time
2. Fixing team data processing to ensure player and enemy teams are properly copied and displayed in battle

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Mode Separation

#### Problem
The battle system was initializing both UI systems (DOM-based `BattleUI` and Phaser-based `BattleScene`) simultaneously, causing conflicts and redundant processing.

#### Solution
- Added a `uiMode` flag to BattleManager with possible values: "dom" or "phaser"
- Modified `BattleManager.startBattle()` to check this flag before initializing the DOM-based UI
- Updated `BattleBridge.initialize()` to set `battleManager.uiMode = "phaser"` when initialized
- Added detailed logging to track which UI mode is active during battle initialization

#### Code Changes
- Added `this.uiMode = "dom";` property in `BattleManager` constructor
- Updated the UI initialization check in `startBattle()` to respect the `uiMode` setting
- Modified `BattleBridge.initialize()` to set the `uiMode` to "phaser"

### 2. Team Data Processing Fix

#### Problem
The battle system was showing 0 heroes in battle logs despite teams being visible in Phaser. This was caused by:
- Improper reference handling between TeamManager, BattleManager, and BattleScene
- Lack of proper validation for team data during preparation
- Inconsistent deep copying of team data

#### Solution
- Implemented consistent deep copying of team data using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` 
- Added comprehensive validation for team data at multiple levels
- Added detailed logging at key transfer points to trace data flow
- Fixed the team type detection logic to properly identify player vs. enemy teams
- Implemented null filtering to remove any invalid character entries

#### Code Changes
- Modified `BattleManager.startBattle()` to properly validate and deep copy teams
- Enhanced `prepareTeamForBattle()` with improved validation and team type detection
- Added filtering of null entries in prepared teams
- Added explicit logging of team sizes before and after preparation

## Technical Notes

### Validation Improvements
The update adds several layers of validation:
1. Team array validation to ensure we're working with proper arrays
2. Individual character validation during team preparation
3. Null filtering after team preparation
4. Size comparison checks to verify preparation succeeded

### Logging Enhancements
Added detailed logging to trace team data throughout the process:
- Team size before and after preparation
- Team type detection results
- Character validation failures
- Completion status of team preparation

### Edge Case Handling
- Properly handles empty or undefined team arrays
- Handles null characters within teams
- Provides fallback behavior when validation fails
- Ensures consistent team types with explicit assignment

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with both UI modes to ensure the correct UI is displayed
- Test with various team sizes to verify correct processing
- Test edge cases like empty teams or teams with invalid characters
- Check battle logs to verify team sizes are correctly reported

## Known Limitations
- The fallback team generation for missing enemy teams remains unchanged
- Teams must still be valid JavaScript arrays with proper character objects
- Character objects still need to have valid minimum properties (stats, etc.)


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.10b.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10b - Team Data Flow & Battle Outcome Fix

## Overview
This update addresses two critical issues identified in version 0.5.0.10:

1. **Team Data Flow Issue**: Fixed the problem where player team data was being lost when starting a battle via the Battle Control Panel, resulting in "0 heroes vs 3 enemies" in battles.
2. **Battle Completion Issue**: Added a proper battle outcome screen to prevent the quick return to TeamBuilder after battles, allowing players to see their results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Team Data Flow Fix

#### Problem
When initiating battles from the Battle Control Panel, the panel wasn't retrieving the team data from the BattleScene, resulting in `undefined` being passed to BattleManager which then defaulted to empty arrays.

#### Solution
- Modified `BattleBridge.startBattle()` to accept team parameters
- Updated `BattleControlPanel.onStartBattleClicked()` to retrieve team data from its parent scene
- Enhanced `BattleScene.init()` to properly deep copy and store team data
- Added `BattleScene.getTeamData()` utility method for safe team data access
- Implemented proper JSON deep copying at critical handoff points

#### Code Changes
- **BattleBridge.js**: Updated `startBattle()` to accept and forward team parameters
- **BattleControlPanel.js**: 
  - Modified `onStartBattleClicked()` to retrieve team data from scene
  - Added deep copying of team data to prevent reference issues
- **BattleScene.js**:
  - Enhanced `init()` to deep copy and validate team data
  - Added `getTeamData()` utility method

### 2. Battle Outcome Screen

#### Problem
Once a battle concluded, there was no feedback to the user about the result, and the system sometimes returned to TeamBuilder UI immediately.

#### Solution
- Added a `showBattleOutcome()` method to BattleScene
- Connected the method to battle end events via BattleBridge
- Created a visually appealing outcome screen with victory/defeat message
- Added explicit "Return to Team Builder" button for user control
- Ensured the outcome screen persists until user chooses to return

#### Code Changes
- **BattleScene.js**:
  - Added `showBattleOutcome()` method with animation and styling
  - Connected battle end events to the outcome screen
  - Added proper cleanup in `shutdown()`
  - Modified battle bridge event listener for battle end events

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test starting a battle with the Control Panel's "Start Battle" button
2. Verify player team appears correctly in battle (should show all heroes)
3. Let the battle play to completion and verify the outcome screen appears
4. Test both victory and defeat scenarios
5. Verify that returning to TeamBuilder only happens when clicking the return button

## Impact
These changes enhance the player experience by ensuring:
1. Battles always have the correct teams regardless of how they're initiated
2. Players can see the results of their battles before returning to TeamBuilder
3. Users have explicit control over when to return to TeamBuilder

This version builds on the UI Mode separation and team data fixes from 0.5.0.10 to provide a more robust and user-friendly battle experience.

# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c - Battle Log UI & Pause Fix

## Overview
This update addresses two critical issues from the previous version:
1. Fixed the pauseBattle/resumeBattle functionality
2. Added a comprehensive Battle Log UI for better player feedback

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Pause Button Functionality

#### Problem
The pause button was failing with `TypeError: this.battleManager.pauseBattle is not a function` because the method wasn't implemented.

#### Solution
- Added dedicated `pauseBattle()` and `resumeBattle()` methods to BattleManager
- Updated BattleControlPanel to properly handle pause/resume with better fallbacks
- Improved error handling for pause/resume operations

#### Code Changes
- Added two new methods to BattleManager:
  - `pauseBattle()`: Safely pauses the battle and clears timers
  - `resumeBattle()`: Safely resumes the battle from a paused state
- Updated BattleControlPanel to use these methods through BattleBridge
- Added fallback to directly use window.battleManager if BattleBridge is unavailable

### 2. Battle Log UI Implementation

#### Problem
Battle events were being logged to the console but not displayed to the user in-game.

#### Solution
- Created a new `BattleLogPanel` component for displaying battle events
- Enhanced BattleManager's logging system to dispatch events through BattleBridge
- Added a dedicated `BATTLE_LOG` event type to BattleBridge
- Integrated the log panel into the BattleScene

#### Code Changes
- **New Component**: Created `BattleLogPanel.js` with:
  - Scrollable log with message history
  - Color-coded message types
  - Auto-scrolling functionality
  - Clear log button
  - Connection to BattleBridge events
- **BattleManager Updates**:
  - Enhanced `logMessage()` method to dispatch events through BattleBridge
  - Added validation for message types
  - Improved error handling
- **BattleBridge Updates**:
  - Added `BATTLE_LOG` event type
  - Improved handling of log message dispatching
- **BattleScene Updates**:
  - Added log panel creation and initialization
  - Properly cleaned up log panel on scene shutdown

### 3. First-Entry Crash Fix

The implementation addresses the first-entry crash issue through:
- Improved handling of status effect loading in BattleManager
- Better error recovery with fallback mechanisms in BattleControlPanel
- More robust initialization sequence in BattleScene

## Technical Notes

### Battle Log Features
- Displays color-coded messages for different event types:
  - Default: White
  - Info: Light blue
  - Success: Light green 
  - Action: Orange/yellow
  - Error: Light red
  - Player: Light blue
  - Enemy: Light red
- Auto-scrolling with manual scroll controls
- Message history with timestamp
- Clear log button

### Error Handling Improvements
- Improved error capture and recovery
- Better logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when components are missing

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the Battle Log UI during battle
   - Verify color coding works correctly
   - Test scrolling functionality
   - Confirm log messages match battle events
2. Test the Pause button functionality
   - Verify pause stops all battle actions
   - Verify resume continues the battle correctly
   - Test with different battle speeds
3. Test first-entry crash fix
   - Start a new battle after page load
   - Verify the battle loads correctly on first try

## Known Limitations
- Auto-scrolling may not keep up with very fast battle speeds
- Some minor UI positioning may need adjustment based on screen size
- Log messages are limited to ~30 entries to prevent performance issues


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.10c_hotfix.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c Hotfix - Battle Log UI Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses the missing Battle Log UI in the Phaser-based battle scene.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Battle Log Panel Loading

#### Problem
The BattleLogPanel component was created but not properly loaded in the HTML file, resulting in "BattleLogPanel class not found" errors.

#### Solution
- Added the missing script tag in index.html to load BattleLogPanel.js
- Enhanced the log panel size and visibility settings
- Improved error handling when the panel can't be initialized

#### Code Changes
- Added `<script src="js/phaser/components/battle/BattleLogPanel.js" defer></script>` to index.html
- Increased the panel size in BattleScene from 350px to 400px
- Improved visual settings for better readability (opacity, font size, padding)

### 2. UI Improvements for Battle Log

- Increased maximum message count from 20 to 30
- Improved text contrast and readability
- Enhanced panel size and positioning for better visibility

## Technical Notes

### Script Loading Order
The script loading order is critical in this application. The BattleLogPanel.js needs to be loaded before BattleScene.js attempts to use it. The defer attribute ensures that scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML file.

### Visual Enhancements
- Increased background opacity from 0.85 to 0.90
- Increased font size from 14px to 15px
- Increased padding from 10px to 12px

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test that the Battle Log UI now appears in the battle scene
2. Verify that battle events are logged properly
3. Test scrolling and ensure messages are readable

## Known Limitations
- The log panel position is fixed and might need adjustment for different screen sizes
- Very long messages might be truncated in the display


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.10c_hotfix2.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c Hotfix 2 - Battle Log Text Visibility Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses the issues with the Battle Log UI where the log panel was visible but the text wasn't showing properly, and errors were occurring when processing status effect messages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Status Effect Display Errors

#### Problem
The BattleLogPanel was correctly loaded and initialized, but there were recurring errors when trying to display status effect messages:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
at BattleLogPanel.js:256
```

#### Solution
- Added defensive error handling in the status effect event handler
- Implemented multiple fallback paths for accessing status effect names
- Added proper error catching to prevent errors from blocking other messages
- Made text display more robust against various data formats

#### Code Changes
- Updated the `STATUS_EFFECT_APPLIED` event handler with extensive error handling
- Added similar error handling to other event handlers for consistency
- Improved the status effect name formatting to handle various formats

### 2. Enhanced Battle Log Visual Appearance

#### Problem
The Battle Log panel was present but text was not sufficiently visible on the background.

#### Solution
- Increased text contrast and visibility with text shadows, strokes, and larger font size
- Enhanced the log panel background and border with more contrast and opacity
- Made important messages (action, error, success) bold for better visibility
- Adjusted title bar and title text to stand out more

#### Code Changes
- Enhanced text rendering with stroke, shadow and improved styling
- Made title bar brighter blue (0x3366aa) with more opacity (0.95)
- Increased border thickness to 3px with blue color (0x4488ff)
- Updated message colors to brighter variants for better visibility
- Made the log panel background more opaque (0.95 vs 0.85) and slightly blue-tinted

## Technical Notes

### Error Handling Strategy
- Added try/catch blocks around event handlers to isolate errors
- Used defensive property access patterns to handle varying data structures
- Implemented fallback messages when specific data is unavailable
- Added detailed warning logs to help with future debugging

### Visual Enhancements
- Text with shadows and strokes for better readability
- Bold styling for important messages
- Increased font size from 14px to 16px
- Added text shadow and stroke details to improve contrast
- Brighter, more saturated colors for message types

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start a battle and verify that the Battle Log text is now visible
2. Check that status effects are correctly displayed without errors
3. Verify that different message types (action, info, success, error) have appropriate color coding
4. Check that the title "Battle Log" is clearly visible

## Known Limitations
- Some system messages from BattleManager might not be perfectly formatted
- Very long messages might still be cut off in the display area


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.10d.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10d - Detailed Technical Notes

## Overview
This update addresses a critical issue with the Battle Log UI in the Phaser-based battle scene. While the Battle Log panel was visible, it wasn't showing any messages during battles. The root cause was a missing connection between BattleManager's `logMessage` method and the BattleLogPanel component. This changelog details the specific changes made to fix this issue and add robust testing capabilities.

## Diagnosis and Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
The Battle Log panel was correctly created and visible in the Phaser UI, but no messages were appearing during battle. 

### Root Causes
1. **Missing Event Dispatch**: BattleManager's `logMessage` method was not dispatching events through the BattleBridge system
2. **Incomplete Event Flow**: The message event pathway from BattleManager through BattleBridge to BattleLogPanel was incomplete
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: No diagnostic information was available to identify where the message flow was breaking down

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. BattleManager Message Event Dispatch
Modified `js/managers/BattleManager.js` to dispatch events through BattleBridge:

```javascript
logMessage(message, type = 'default') {
    // Log to console for debugging
    console.log(`[BattleLog ${type}]: ${message}`);
    
    // Dispatch event through BattleBridge if available
    if (window.battleBridge) {
        try {
            window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_LOG, {
                message: message,
                type: type,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.warn('Failed to dispatch battle log event:', error);
        }
    }
    
    // Existing code continues...
}
```

This change ensures that every message logged by BattleManager is also dispatched through the BattleBridge event system with the appropriate data structure.

### 2. Enhanced BattleLogPanel Event Handling
Modified `js/phaser/components/battle/BattleLogPanel.js` to add better error handling and debugging:

```javascript
// Listen for the battle log events directly from BattleManager
bridge.addEventListener(bridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_LOG, (data) => {
    try {
        console.log('BattleLogPanel received BATTLE_LOG event:', data);
        if (!data || !data.message) {
            console.warn('BattleLogPanel: BATTLE_LOG event missing message data', data);
            return;
        }
        this.addMessage(data.message, data.type || 'default');
        console.log('BattleLogPanel: Added message to log:', data.message);
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('Error handling BATTLE_LOG event:', error);
    }
});

// Add a test message to confirm the panel is working
this.addMessage('Battle log panel connected to battle events', 'success');
```

These changes provide detailed logging about received events and add a confirmation message to verify the panel is functioning.

### 3. Diagnostic Enhancements in BattleBridge
Improved `js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridge.js` to add detailed tracing and diagnostics:

```javascript
dispatchEvent(eventType, data) {
    console.log(`BattleBridge: Dispatching event ${eventType}`, data);
    
    if (!this.eventListeners[eventType]) {
        console.warn(`BattleBridge: No listeners for event "${eventType}"`);
        return;
    }
    
    // Log listener count for debugging
    console.log(`BattleBridge: Found ${this.eventListeners[eventType].length} listeners for ${eventType}`);
    
    // Add event type to data for reference
    const eventData = {
        ...data,
        type: eventType,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    
    try {
        this.eventListeners[eventType].forEach((callback, index) => {
            try {
                console.log(`BattleBridge: Calling listener ${index} for ${eventType}`);
                callback(eventData);
                console.log(`BattleBridge: Listener ${index} completed successfully`);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`BattleBridge: Error in event listener ${index} for "${eventType}":`, error);
            }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`BattleBridge: Error dispatching event "${eventType}":`, error);
    }
}
```

This provides complete visibility into the event dispatch process, showing how many listeners exist for each event type and tracking the execution of each listener.

### 4. BattleScene Integration Enhancements
Updated `js/phaser/scenes/BattleScene.js` to add direct testing and initialization feedback:

```javascript
// Add test messages directly
this.battleLogPanel.addMessage('Battle log initialized successfully', 'success');
this.battleLogPanel.addMessage('Ready for battle events', 'info');

// For testing only - send a test message through BattleBridge if available
if (this.battleBridge) {
    console.log('BattleScene: Sending test message through BattleBridge');
    this.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_LOG, {
        message: 'Test message from BattleScene via BattleBridge',
        type: 'info'
    });
} else {
    console.warn('BattleScene: BattleBridge not available for test message');
}

// Add direct access for testing in console
window.battleLogPanel = this.battleLogPanel;
```

These additions provide immediate visual feedback that the panel is working and create a global reference for debugging.

### 5. New Testing Utilities
Created `js/phaser/bridge/BattleLogTester.js` with comprehensive testing functions:

```javascript
// Create a global testing utility
window.testBattleLog = function(message, type = 'info') {
    console.log(`Sending test message to battle log: ${message}`);
    
    if (window.battleBridge) {
        window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_LOG, {
            message: message,
            type: type
        });
        return true;
    } else {
        console.error('BattleBridge not available for testing');
        return false;
    }
};

// Create a function to test direct message addition
window.addDirectBattleLogMessage = function(message, type = 'info') {
    console.log(`Adding message directly to battle log: ${message}`);
    
    if (window.battleLogPanel) {
        window.battleLogPanel.addMessage(message, type);
        return true;
    } else {
        console.error('Battle log panel not available for direct message');
        return false;
    }
};

// Create a function to test multiple message types
window.testAllMessageTypes = function() {
    const types = ['default', 'info', 'success', 'action', 'error', 'player', 'enemy'];
    
    types.forEach(type => {
        window.testBattleLog(`Test message with type: ${type}`, type);
    });
    
    return 'All message types tested';
};
```

These utilities provide a convenient way to test the battle log from the browser console without having to trigger specific battle events.

### 6. Updated HTML File
Modified `index.html` to include the new BattleLogTester.js file:

```html
<script src="js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridgeInit.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/phaser/bridge/BattleLogTester.js" defer></script>
```

This ensures the testing utilities are available once the page loads.

## Testing Process
The fixes were tested using the following methods:

1. **Direct Message Testing:**
   - Used the browser console to call `window.testBattleLog("Test message")`, which verified the BattleBridge event dispatch was working
   - Used `window.addDirectBattleLogMessage("Direct message")` to verify the BattleLogPanel's addMessage method was working
   - Used `window.testAllMessageTypes()` to verify all message types were displaying correctly with appropriate styles

2. **Battle Flow Testing:**
   - Started battles and confirmed log messages appeared naturally during the battle sequence
   - Verified status effect messages, turn notifications, and damage/healing messages all displayed correctly
   - Tested battle start/end events to confirm those messages appeared in the log

3. **Error Recovery Testing:**
   - Tested with invalid message data to verify error handling worked properly
   - Confirmed that errors in one message didn't prevent subsequent messages from being displayed

## Edge Cases Addressed

1. **Race Conditions:**
   - Added safety checks to ensure messages aren't sent before the BattleLogPanel is initialized
   - Implemented fallbacks when BattleBridge isn't available

2. **Invalid Message Types:**
   - Added validation for message types with fallback to 'default' type
   - Ensured all message types render with appropriate styling

3. **Error Propagation:**
   - Added try/catch blocks around all event handling to prevent cascading failures
   - Implemented detailed error logging to facilitate future debugging

## Performance Considerations
- The added diagnostic logging is primarily intended for development and debugging
- In a production build, many of the console.log statements could be removed for better performance
- The message handling architecture itself has minimal performance impact

## Future Work
- Implement a toggle for debug logging to reduce console noise
- Add a message buffer to handle high-volume logging during intense battles
- Consider adding search/filter functionality to the battle log UI for longer sessions
- Add visual effects for important message types (flashing, animations, etc.)


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.11.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.11 - Detailed Technical Notes

## Overview
This update fixes a critical UI issue where battle log text wasn't respecting the boundaries of the log panel. While messages were appearing correctly after our previous fix (0.5.0.10d), they were extending beyond the panel's boundaries, affecting readability and visual presentation.

## Diagnosis and Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
Battle log messages were displaying correctly but weren't contained within the blue panel boundaries. Text would extend beyond the right edge of the panel, making messages difficult to read and breaking the UI's visual design.

### Root Causes
1. **Incorrect Text Positioning Method**: Text objects were being created with absolute scene coordinates rather than being properly added to the text container
2. **Ineffective Container Usage**: The textContainer was created correctly but wasn't being used to properly contain and manage the text objects
3. **Suboptimal Word Wrapping**: While wordWrap was being applied, it lacked the necessary configuration to ensure proper text containment

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Proper Text Container Usage
Modified the text rendering approach to properly use Phaser's container system:

```javascript
// OLD: Created text directly on the scene with absolute positioning
const text = this.scene.add.text(
    this.x - this.width/2 + 20, // Absolute X position
    this.y - this.height/2 + yPos, // Absolute Y position
    `[${message.timestamp}] ${message.text}`,
    textStyle
);

// NEW: Create text with container-relative positioning
const text = this.scene.add.text(
    this.options.padding,  // Relative X position within container
    yPos,                  // Relative Y position within container
    `[${message.timestamp}] ${message.text}`,
    textStyle
);

// Add to container - the key step that was missing
this.textContainer.add(text);
```

### 2. Enhanced Word Wrapping Configuration
Improved the word wrapping configuration to ensure text stays within boundaries:

```javascript
// OLD: Basic word wrapping that wasn't properly constraining text
wordWrap: { width: this.width - (this.options.padding * 2) - 10 }

// NEW: Enhanced word wrapping with better measurement and algorithm
wordWrap: { 
    width: availableWidth,
    useAdvancedWrap: true  // More accurate wrapping
}
```

### 3. Proper Container Positioning
Added explicit positioning of the text container to ensure it aligns properly within the panel:

```javascript
// Position the textContainer appropriately within the panel
this.textContainer.setPosition(-this.width/2 + this.options.padding, -this.height/2 + 40);
```

### 4. Removed Debugging Background Color
Removed the purple background color that was added for debugging purposes:

```javascript
// REMOVED: Debugging background color
textStyle.backgroundColor = '#550055';  // Purple background
```

### 5. Proper Cleanup of Text Container
Added explicit clearing of the text container before re-rendering to prevent accumulation of text objects:

```javascript
// Clear text container contents
this.textContainer.removeAll(true);
```

## Visual Improvements

The fix provides several visual improvements:

1. **Contained Text**: All text now properly wraps within the panel boundaries
2. **Improved Word Wrapping**: Text breaks more naturally at word boundaries
3. **Cleaner Appearance**: Removed debugging background colors for a cleaner look
4. **Proper Scrolling**: Ensures the scrolling behavior works correctly with text of any length

## Testing Process

The implementation was tested using the following methods:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verified that all text now stays within the panel boundaries
   - Tested with a variety of message lengths to ensure proper wrapping
   - Verified that the text container masks correctly cut off text at panel boundaries

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Tested with extremely long messages to ensure proper wrapping
   - Verified scrolling behavior with many messages
   - Confirmed compatibility with different message types (error, success, etc.)

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Monitored performance with a large number of messages
   - Checked for any rendering issues related to the text container approach

## Future Work

While this fix addresses the immediate issue of text boundaries, some potential future improvements include:

1. **Text Formatting Enhancements**: Add support for rich text formatting (bold, italics, colors within messages)
2. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize text rendering for large numbers of messages
3. **Visualization Improvements**: Add visual indicators for important messages (icons, animations)
4. **Custom Scrollbar**: Replace the current up/down buttons with a proper scrollbar for easier navigation

## Notes on Implementation Strategy

This implementation focused on using Phaser's built-in container system correctly rather than creating a custom solution. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Leverages Phaser's Optimizations**: Uses Phaser's built-in optimizations for containers and text rendering
2. **Simplifies Code**: Reduces the complexity of the text positioning logic
3. **Improves Maintainability**: Makes future UI adjustments easier to implement
4. **Ensures Compatibility**: Works consistently across different Phaser versions and contexts

By fixing this issue, the Battle Log now provides a much better user experience with properly contained and readable text, improving the overall battle visualization.

# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.12 - Detailed Technical Notes

## Overview
This update completely replaces the complex UI-based battle log panel with a simplified direct text display system. After encountering persistent issues with text containment and panel boundaries, we made the decision to take a more direct approach by creating a streamlined battle log implementation that prioritizes reliability and readability.

## Motivation
The original BattleLogPanel component had several issues:
1. **Complex UI Structure**: Panel-based UI with borders, buttons, and scrolling mechanisms added unnecessary complexity
2. **Rendering Issues**: Text content frequently rendered incorrectly relative to panel boundaries 
3. **Overcomplicated Positioning**: Conflict between absolute and container-relative positioning
4. **Multiple Rendering Pathways**: Inconsistent approaches to adding text elements

Rather than continuing to patch an overly complex system, this update takes a new approach with a focused, simplified design.

## Key Changes

### 1. New DirectBattleLog Component
Created a completely new implementation in `js/phaser/components/battle/DirectBattleLog.js`:

```javascript
// Main structure
class DirectBattleLog {
    constructor(scene, x, y, width, options = {}) {
        // Simple container for all text
        this.container = this.scene.add.container(this.x, this.y);
        
        // Semi-transparent background
        this.background = this.scene.add.rectangle(
            0, 0, 
            this.width, 10, // Height will be dynamically set
            this.options.backgroundColor,
            this.options.backgroundAlpha
        ).setOrigin(0, 0);
        
        // Connect to battle events
        this.connectToBattleBridge();
    }
}
```

### 2. Simplified Text Rendering Approach
The new rendering approach uses a clean container-based implementation:

```javascript
renderMessages() {
    // Clear existing text objects
    this.container.removeAll(true);
    
    // Recreate background
    this.background = this.scene.add.rectangle(...);
    this.container.add(this.background);
    
    // Track total height for background sizing
    let totalHeight = this.options.padding;
    
    // Create text objects for visible messages
    this.messages.forEach((message, index) => {
        // Create text with proper word wrapping
        const text = this.scene.add.text(
            this.options.padding,
            yPos,
            `[${message.timestamp}] ${message.text}`,
            textStyle
        );
        
        // Add to container
        this.container.add(text);
        
        // Update height for next message
        totalHeight += text.height + this.options.lineSpacing;
    });
    
    // Resize background to fit content
    this.background.height = totalHeight + this.options.padding;
}
```

### 3. Integration With BattleScene
Modified `BattleScene.js` to use the new component:

```javascript
createBattleLogPanel() {
    try {
        // Check if DirectBattleLog class exists
        if (typeof DirectBattleLog === 'function') {
            // Create the direct battle log in the right side of the screen
            this.battleLog = new DirectBattleLog(
                this, 
                this.cameras.main.width - 350, // X position (right side)
                50,                            // Y position (top)
                300,                           // Width
                {
                    backgroundColor: 0x000000,
                    backgroundAlpha: 0.5,
                    fontSize: 16,
                    maxMessages: 30,
                    padding: 10
                }
            );
            
            // Code to test and initialize the battle log...
            
            console.log('Battle log created successfully');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating battle log:', error);
        this.showErrorMessage('Failed to create battle log');
    }
}
```

### 4. Event System Integration
The DirectBattleLog connects to the same BattleBridge events as the original panel:

```javascript
connectToBattleBridge() {
    if (this.scene.battleBridge) {
        const bridge = this.scene.battleBridge;
        
        // Connect to BATTLE_LOG events
        bridge.addEventListener(bridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_LOG, (data) => {
            try {
                console.log('DirectBattleLog received BATTLE_LOG event:', data);
                if (!data || !data.message) {
                    console.warn('DirectBattleLog: BATTLE_LOG event missing message data', data);
                    return;
                }
                this.addMessage(data.message, data.type || 'default');
            } catch (error) {
                console.warn('Error handling BATTLE_LOG event:', error);
            }
        });
        
        // Additional event listeners for turn started, abilities, etc.
    }
}
```

## Specific Implementation Details

### Message Types and Styling
The new implementation maintains the same message type styling as the original:

```javascript
this.messageTypes = {
    default: { color: '#ffffff' },   // White
    info: { color: '#4dabff' },      // Brighter blue
    success: { color: '#5aff5a' },   // Brighter green
    action: { color: '#ffee55' },    // Even brighter yellow
    error: { color: '#ff7777' },     // Even brighter red
    player: { color: '#66bbff' },    // Brighter blue for player
    enemy: { color: '#ff7777' }      // Brighter red for enemy
};
```

### Semi-Transparent Background
The background is created as a simple rectangle that resizes dynamically to fit the content:

```javascript
this.background = this.scene.add.rectangle(
    0, 0, 
    this.width, 10, // Height will be dynamically set
    this.options.backgroundColor,
    this.options.backgroundAlpha
).setOrigin(0, 0);
```

This background is recreated each time messages are rendered, with its height adjusted to accommodate all visible messages.

### Word Wrapping Configuration
The text wrapping is configured to properly contain messages within the log width:

```javascript
const textStyle = {
    fontFamily: this.options.fontFamily,
    fontSize: this.options.fontSize,
    color: color,
    wordWrap: {
        width: this.width - (this.options.padding * 2),
        useAdvancedWrap: true
    },
    stroke: '#000000',
    strokeThickness: 1
};
```

### Location and UI Update
The log is positioned on the right side of the screen for better visibility:

```javascript
this.battleLog = new DirectBattleLog(
    this, 
    this.cameras.main.width - 350, // X position (right side)
    50,                            // Y position (top)
    300,                           // Width
    // Options...
);
```

## Legacy Code Handling
The old BattleLogPanel.js file has been commented out and marked for deletion. We've kept it temporarily in the codebase with clear deprecation notices:

```javascript
/**
 * BattleLogPanel.js
 * DEPRECATED: This complex panel has been replaced by DirectBattleLog.js
 * @version 0.5.0.10ce
 * @deprecated Use DirectBattleLog instead
 */

// NOTE: This entire file is marked for deletion. It has been replaced by a simpler
// DirectBattleLog implementation that doesn't use the complex panel UI.
// The code is kept for reference but will be removed in a future update.
```

## Testing Process
The implementation was tested using the following methods:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verified that text appears within the intended area with semi-transparent background
   - Tested with various message types and lengths
   - Confirmed that text properly wraps within the designated width

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Verified that all battle events generate corresponding log messages
   - Checked that messages display with appropriate styling based on type
   - Confirmed that the log updates in real time as battle progresses

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Tested with extremely long messages to confirm proper wrapping
   - Checked behavior with large numbers of messages to ensure handling of message limits
   - Verified clean behavior during scene transitions

## Future Work

While the new implementation significantly improves reliability, some potential future enhancements include:

1. **Scrollable Messages**: If needed, add a simple scroll functionality for viewing message history
2. **Enhanced Styling**: Add additional visual effects for important messages
3. **Message Filtering**: Add options to filter messages by type or source
4. **Animations**: Add subtle animations for new messages to draw attention

## Conclusion

This simplification of the battle log system dramatically improves reliability by focusing on the core functionalityâ€”displaying informative messages about battle eventsâ€”while eliminating complex UI elements that were causing issues. The direct container-based approach with proper text wrapping ensures messages will stay within bounds and be clearly readable during gameplay.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.13.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.13 - Battle Log Height Limitation

## Problem Analysis
The battle log component (`DirectBattleLog`) was displaying an unlimited number of messages that would extend beyond the visible screen area. This created several issues:
1. Messages would render off-screen where users couldn't see them
2. Performance impact from rendering unnecessary off-screen text objects
3. Poor user experience with no clear visual boundary for the log panel
4. No prioritization of recent (more relevant) messages over older ones

## Implementation Approach
Our solution focused on three key areas:

### 1. Height Constraint System
- Added a `maxHeight` property to the `DirectBattleLog` component
- Default value set to 50% of screen height using `scene.cameras.main.height * 0.5`
- Made `maxHeight` configurable through options for flexibility
- Added proper height validation throughout render cycle

### 2. Message Rendering Logic Overhaul
Changed the message rendering approach from:
- **Before**: Display all messages, regardless of available space
- **After**: Calculate available space and display only messages that fit

The new rendering algorithm works backwards from newest to oldest messages:
```javascript
// Calculate available height for messages (subtracting padding)
const availableHeight = this.maxHeight - (this.options.padding * 2);

// Create temporary texts to measure their heights
let messagesToShow = [];
let messageHeights = [];
let totalHeightNeeded = 0;

// Measure all messages (starting from newest/last)
for (let i = this.messages.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const message = this.messages[i];
    
    // Create temporary text to measure height
    const tempText = this.scene.add.text(
        0, 0,
        `[${message.timestamp}] ${message.text}`,
        {
            fontFamily: this.options.fontFamily,
            fontSize: this.options.fontSize,
            wordWrap: {
                width: this.width - (this.options.padding * 2),
                useAdvancedWrap: true
            }
        }
    );
    
    // Store the height measurement
    const messageHeight = tempText.height + this.options.lineSpacing;
    tempText.destroy(); // Remove temporary text
    
    // Check if adding this message would exceed available height
    if (totalHeightNeeded + messageHeight <= availableHeight) {
        messagesToShow.unshift(message); // Add to beginning of array
        messageHeights.unshift(messageHeight);
        totalHeightNeeded += messageHeight;
    } else {
        // No more space for messages
        break;
    }
}
```

### 3. Scene Integration
Updated `BattleScene.js` to:
- Explicitly calculate and pass `maxHeight` to the battle log
- Make the constraint clear in the scene configuration
- Ensure the battle log positioning works well with other UI elements

## Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Management**: We carefully destroy temporary text objects used for measurement
2. **Optimization**: Only render visible messages instead of the entire history
3. **Text Object Pooling**: We considered but did not implement text object pooling at this stage
4. **GPU Impact**: Fewer rendered objects means less GPU overhead

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Clarity**: The battle log now has a clear visual boundary
2. **Relevant Information**: Users always see the most recent (and relevant) messages
3. **Consistent UI**: The battle log maintains consistent positioning and sizing

## Before/After Comparison
Before:
- Battle log height: Unlimited
- Message display: All messages shown, regardless of screen boundaries
- Message prioritization: None
- Background sizing: Grew to contain all messages

After:
- Battle log height: Limited to 50% of screen height
- Message display: Only messages that fit within the height constraint
- Message prioritization: Most recent messages given priority
- Background sizing: Capped at maximum height

## Future Considerations
1. **Scrolling Interface**: A scrollbar could be added in the future to browse older messages
2. **Message Filtering**: Could add category filtering options (damage, healing, effects)
3. **Message Animation**: Could add fade-in/fade-out effects for new messages
4. **Message Export**: Could add battle log export functionality for sharing battles

## Technical Debt Impact
This change reduces technical debt by:
1. Making the battle log component more predictable and bounded
2. Preventing potential performance issues from unlimited message rendering
3. Establishing proper height constraint patterns that can be reused elsewhere
4. Improving the architectural pattern with proper measurement before rendering

# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.14.md

## Implementation Details for Battle Log Event Coverage Enhancement

### Problem

The battle log was missing many important battle events, resulting in an incomplete record of the battle for players. Key events like character actions, passive ability triggers, status effect expiration, critical hits, and type effectiveness messages were not consistently displayed in the Phaser-based battle log. This made it difficult for players to understand what was happening during combat.

Additionally, a syntax error in the BattleManager.js file prevented the game from loading properly.

### Solution Overview

The solution involved three main components:

1. **Enhanced DirectBattleLog.js Event Handling**:
   - Added event listeners for previously unhandled event types
   - Improved existing event handlers to provide more context and clarity
   - Added a message forwarding system to capture all BattleManager logs

2. **BattleManager.js Messaging Improvements**:
   - Fixed critical syntax error that was breaking the game
   - Cleaned up the logMessage method to ensure proper functionality
   - Added redundant dispatches for mission-critical battle events
   - Ensured consistent handling for various message types

3. **Improved Event Handling for Special Messages**:
   - Added special handling for critical hit notifications
   - Enhanced type effectiveness messages
   - Added proper team identification in all messages

### Implementation Details

#### 1. BattleManager.js Fix

The BattleManager.js file contained a syntax error in the logMessage method which was preventing the game from loading. This was fixed by:

- Cleaning up the method implementation
- Removing duplicate code and incorrect syntax
- Ensuring proper event dispatching
- Adding proper error handling with try/catch blocks

#### 2. DirectBattleLog.js Enhancements

The DirectBattleLog component was updated to include:

- **New Event Listeners**:
  - CHARACTER_ACTION - Captures ability usage and basic attacks
  - PASSIVE_TRIGGERED - Shows when character passive abilities activate
  - STATUS_EFFECT_REMOVED - Provides notification when status effects expire

- **Message Forwarder**:
  - Hooks into BattleManager's logMessage method to capture all log messages
  - Creates direct flow of information from BattleManager to the battle log
  - Ensures consistent formatting of different message types

- **Improved Event Context**:
  - Enhanced team identification in messages (ally/enemy)
  - Added detailed information about damage/healing sources
  - Improved passive ability trigger visualization

#### 3. Special Message Handling

Special message types were added for:

- Critical hits (type: 'critical')
- Type effectiveness messages (type: 'type')
- Team-specific messages (type: 'player' or 'enemy')

Each type has appropriate styling and formatting to make important events stand out in the battle log.

### Technical Notes

- Fixed syntax errors in BattleManager.js that were breaking the game
- Implemented proper error handling throughout all event handlers
- Enhanced message formatting with appropriate timestamps and team identification
- Added height limitation to prevent overflow of battle log messages

### Future Improvements

This update represents Phase 1 of battle log improvements, focusing on event coverage. Future phases will address:

- Phase 2: Message rendering optimization and scrolling improvements
- Phase 3: Visual enhancements and theming support
- Phase 4: Advanced filtering options for battle log messages

### Testing

Before deploying this update, verify:

- All battle events appear correctly in the log
- Critical hits and type effectiveness messages are properly displayed
- Passive abilities show appropriate feedback when triggered
- Status effects show application and expiration messages
- Team identification is clear in all messages

# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.14_hotfix.md

## Hotfix for Battle System: Message Forwarding Fix

### Issue
A syntax error was introduced in the BattleManager.js file during the update to version 0.5.0.14, causing the battle system to fail to load entirely. The error occurred in the logMessage method where incomplete edits caused a syntax breakdown.

### Fix
- **Corrected logMessage Method**: Fixed the syntax error in BattleManager.js that was preventing the game from loading
- **Properly Implemented Event Forwarding**: Ensured that all battle log messages are properly forwarded to the Phaser battle log
- **Added Error Handling**: Improved error recovery to prevent similar issues in the future

### Technical Approach
The hotfix specifically:
1. Repaired the logMessage method in BattleManager.js to properly forward battle events
2. Fixed the integration between BattleManager and BattleBridge event system
3. Corrected the implementation of type effectiveness messaging

This hotfix preserves all the functionality intended for version 0.5.0.14 while resolving the critical loading issue.

### Implementation Note
The error was detected early and fixed before it could impact players' progression. No game data was affected by this issue.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.24.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.24: Health Bar Update Implementation

## Overview

This update addresses a critical UX issue where character health bars weren't updating during battle, despite battle progress being visible in the battle log. Players could see combat progression in the log but had no visual feedback on the actual health states of characters. This fix creates a complete event-driven system that updates health bars in real-time as characters take damage or receive healing.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Fixed Missing Event Data in BattleBridge.js

In the BattleBridge class, the battle event forwarding lacked crucial health data:

```javascript
// Before:
self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
    target,
    amount,
    source,
    result
});

// After:
self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
    target,
    amount,
    source,
    result,
    newHealth: target.currentHp  // Added this crucial data
});
```

Similar changes were made to CHARACTER_HEALED events to ensure consistent event payload structure. This ensures the crucial health data is passed from BattleManager through BattleBridge to the Phaser visualization layer.

### 2. Enhanced CharacterSprite.js Health Bar System

#### Added Improved updateHealth Method

```javascript
updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth) {
    // Update the internal health tracking
    this.currentHealth = newHealth;
    
    // Update the character data's health tracking
    if (this.character) {
        this.character.currentHp = newHealth;
    }
    
    // Update the visual health bar
    this.updateHealthBar(newHealth, maxHealth);
    
    // Log for debugging
    console.log(`Updating ${this.character.name}'s health to ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
}
```

#### Created Robust updateHealthBar Method

Added a comprehensive updateHealthBar method with:
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Data validation to handle edge cases
- Smooth animation with Phaser tweens
- Dynamic color updates based on health percentage:
  - Green for high health (> 60%)
  - Orange for medium health (30-60%)
  - Red for low health (< 30%)

```javascript
updateHealthBar(currentHealth, maxHealth) {
    try {
        // Skip if health bar components don't exist
        if (!this.healthBar || !this.healthBarBg || !this.hpText) {
            console.warn(`updateHealthBar: Health bar components missing for ${this.character?.name}`);
            return;
        }
        
        // Ensure valid values and calculate percentage
        const safeCurrentHealth = Math.max(0, currentHealth || 0);
        const safeMaxHealth = Math.max(1, maxHealth || 1); // Avoid division by zero
        const healthPercent = Math.min(1, safeCurrentHealth / safeMaxHealth);
        
        // Animate health bar with tweens
        if (this.scene?.tweens) {
            this.scene.tweens.add({
                targets: this.healthBar,
                width: healthBarWidth * healthPercent,
                duration: 200,
                ease: 'Sine.easeOut'
            });
        } else {
            // Direct update if tweens not available
            this.healthBar.width = healthBarWidth * healthPercent;
        }
        
        // Update color and text
        this.healthBar.fillColor = this.getHealthBarColor(healthPercent);
        this.hpText.setText(`${Math.round(safeCurrentHealth)}/${safeMaxHealth}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error updating health bar for ${this.character?.name}:`, error);
    }
}
```

### 3. Added TeamContainer Health Update Method

Created a new method to find a character sprite by ID and update its health:

```javascript
updateCharacterHealth(characterId, newHealth, maxHealth) {
    // Find the character sprite using multiple identifiers for reliability
    const sprite = this.characterSprites.find(sprite => 
        sprite.character.id === characterId || 
        sprite.character.name === characterId ||
        sprite.character.uniqueId === characterId);
    
    if (sprite) {
        sprite.updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth);
        return true;
    }
    
    console.warn(`Could not find character sprite for ID/name: ${characterId}`);
    return false;
}
```

### 4. Added BattleScene Event Handlers

Added handlers in BattleScene.js to listen for health-related events and update the appropriate character sprites:

```javascript
setupHealthUpdateListeners() {
    if (!this.battleBridge) {
        console.error('BattleScene: Cannot set up health update listeners - BattleBridge not connected');
        return;
    }
    
    // Listen for damage and healing events
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener('character_damaged', this.onCharacterDamaged.bind(this));
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener('character_healed', this.onCharacterHealed.bind(this));
    
    console.log('BattleScene: Health update listeners registered');
}

onCharacterDamaged(data) {
    // Extract data safely with defaults
    const character = data.character || data.target;
    const newHealth = data.newHealth !== undefined ? data.newHealth : character.currentHp;
    const maxHealth = character?.stats?.hp || 100;
    
    console.log(`BattleScene: Character damaged - ${character?.name} health now ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
    
    // Route update to the correct team container
    const teamContainer = character?.team === 'player' ? this.playerTeamContainer : this.enemyTeamContainer;
    
    if (teamContainer) {
        teamContainer.updateCharacterHealth(character.id || character.uniqueId || character.name, newHealth, maxHealth);
    } else {
        console.warn(`BattleScene: Could not find team container for ${character?.name}`);
    }
}
```

Similar implementation was added for the `onCharacterHealed` handler.

### 5. Added Debug Testing Functions

For testing and development purposes, added:

- Global testHealthUpdate function available in the browser console
- Test button in debug mode to visually test health bar updates
- Detailed event logging throughout the health update flow

```javascript
testHealthUpdate(teamType = 'player', characterIndex = 0, newHealth = 50) {
    try {
        // Get the appropriate team container
        const teamContainer = teamType === 'player' ? this.playerTeamContainer : this.enemyTeamContainer;
        if (!teamContainer) {
            console.error(`testHealthUpdate: ${teamType} team container not found`);
            return;
        }
        
        // Get character data and create mock event
        const character = characterArray[characterIndex];
        const maxHealth = character.stats.hp || 100;
        
        // Create mock event data
        const mockEventData = {
            character: character,
            newHealth: newHealth,
            amount: character.currentHp - newHealth
        };
        
        // Call appropriate handler based on health change direction
        if (newHealth < character.currentHp) {
            this.onCharacterDamaged(mockEventData);
        } else {
            this.onCharacterHealed(mockEventData);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`testHealthUpdate: Error:`, error);
    }
}
```

## Testing Process

The implementation was tested through:

1. Manual battle testing with real combat actions
2. Direct console testing using the global testHealthUpdate function
3. UI testing with the debug test button
4. Edge case testing with various health values:
   - Zero health (defeat)
   - Full health (healing cap)
   - Extremely low health (1-2 HP)
   - Health threshold transitions (color changes)

## Conclusion

This update completes an essential visual feedback system for battle progression. Players can now see character health states update in real-time as combat progresses, with smooth animations and color changes providing immediate feedback on the battle state. The implementation is robust, with comprehensive error handling and support for multiple character identification methods.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.25_ Health Bars Working.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog: Version 0.5.0.25 (2025-05-05)

## Issue Summary: Health Bar Animation Not Updating During Combat

Despite the battle system correctly calculating and updating health values internally, the health bars in the Phaser-based Battle Scene weren't visually updating to reflect damage or healing. While battle log messages correctly showed health changes, the visual health bars remained static, creating a disconnect between the game state and visual feedback.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, we identified the following root causes:

1. **Event Data Structure Mismatch**: The BattleBridge was dispatching events with a `target` property, but the BattleScene event handlers were looking for a `character` property.

2. **Character Identification Method Mismatch**: The TeamContainer's updateCharacterHealth method was failing to find characters because different identification systems were being used at different stages of the pipeline.

3. **Limited Error Handling**: Without proper error handling and diagnostic capabilities, failures in the health update were silent and difficult to identify.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. BattleBridge.js Modifications

Updated the applyActionEffect patched method to include both `character` and `target` properties in event data:

```javascript
// Before
self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
    target: action.target,
    amount: Math.abs(healthChange),
    source: action.actor,
    ability: action.ability,
    newHealth: targetPostHealth
});

// After
self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
    character: action.target, // IMPORTANT: Use 'character' instead of 'target' to match event handler
    target: action.target,    // Keep 'target' for backward compatibility
    amount: Math.abs(healthChange),
    source: action.actor,
    ability: action.ability,
    newHealth: targetPostHealth
});
```

This dual property approach ensures compatibility with different parts of the system that might expect either property name.

### 2. BattleScene.js Event Handler Enhancements

Enhanced the `onCharacterDamaged` and `onCharacterHealed` event handlers with a multi-stage character lookup approach:

```javascript
// Try each identifier in priority order
if (character.uniqueId) {
    // Try uniqueId first as it's most specific
    const result = teamContainer.updateCharacterHealth(character.uniqueId, newHealth, maxHealth);
    if (result) {
        console.log(`Found character using uniqueId: ${character.uniqueId}`);
        return;
    }
}

if (character.id) {
    // Try id next
    const result = teamContainer.updateCharacterHealth(character.id, newHealth, maxHealth);
    if (result) {
        console.log(`Found character using id: ${character.id}`);
        return;
    }
}

// Fall back to name as last resort
const updateResult = teamContainer.updateCharacterHealth(character.name, newHealth, maxHealth);
```

This approach allows finding characters using multiple identifiers (uniqueId, id, name) with progressive fallbacks.

### 3. TeamContainer.js Character Finding Improvements

Enhanced the `updateCharacterHealth` method with better diagnostic capabilities:

```javascript
// Log available characters for debugging
console.log('Available characters in team:');
this.characterSprites.forEach(sprite => {
    if (sprite && sprite.character) {
        console.log(`- ${sprite.character.name} (id: ${sprite.character.id}, uniqueId: ${sprite.character.uniqueId})`);
    }
});

// Try to find the character sprite that matches this character
const sprite = this.characterSprites.find(sprite => {
    // Check for nulls/undefined first
    if (!sprite || !sprite.character) return false;
    
    // Try each identifier
    const matchesId = sprite.character.id !== undefined && sprite.character.id === characterId;
    const matchesName = sprite.character.name === characterId;
    const matchesUniqueId = sprite.character.uniqueId === characterId;
    
    // Log match attempts for debugging
    if (matchesId || matchesName || matchesUniqueId) {
        console.log(`Found match for ${characterId}: ${sprite.character.name}`);
    }
    
    return matchesId || matchesName || matchesUniqueId;
});
```

This provides detailed logging of all available characters and identification methods, making it easier to diagnose matching issues.

### 4. CharacterSprite.js Health Bar Animation Enhancements

#### Updated `updateHealth` Method:

```javascript
updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth) {
    console.log(`CharacterSprite.updateHealth: ${this.character?.name} health to ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
    
    try {
        // Update the internal health tracking
        this.currentHealth = newHealth;
        
        // Show a health change animation
        const healthChange = (this.previousHealth || newHealth) - newHealth;
        const isHealing = healthChange < 0;
        
        // Store current health for future reference
        this.previousHealth = newHealth;
        
        // Show floating text for significant health changes
        if (Math.abs(healthChange) > 0) {
            const textColor = isHealing ? '#00ff00' : '#ff0000';
            const prefix = isHealing ? '+' : '-';
            const text = `${prefix}${Math.abs(healthChange)}`;
            this.showFloatingText(text, { color: textColor, fontSize: 20 });
        }
        
        // Update the visual health bar
        this.updateHealthBar(newHealth, maxHealth);
        
        // Play a flash effect for damage
        if (healthChange > 0 && this.circle) {
            this.scene.tweens.add({
                targets: this.circle,
                alpha: { from: 1.0, to: 0.3 },
                yoyo: true,
                duration: 100,
                repeat: 1,
                ease: 'Sine.easeOut'
            });
        }
        
        // Play a healing glow effect
        if (healthChange < 0 && this.circle) {
            this.scene.tweens.add({
                targets: this.circle,
                alpha: { from: 1.0, to: 0.6 },
                scaleX: 1.1,
                scaleY: 1.1,
                yoyo: true,
                duration: 200,
                ease: 'Sine.easeOut'
            });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite.updateHealth: Error updating ${this.character?.name}'s health:`, error);
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced `updateHealthBar` Method:

```javascript
updateHealthBar(currentHealth, maxHealth) {
    try {
        // Calculate health percentage (0-1)
        const healthPercent = Math.min(1, safeCurrentHealth / safeMaxHealth);
        
        // Use tweens for smooth transition if available
        if (this.scene?.tweens) {
            // Stop any existing health bar tweens to prevent conflicts
            this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.healthBar);
            
            // Create a new tween for smooth transition
            this.scene.tweens.add({
                targets: this.healthBar,
                width: healthBarWidth * healthPercent,
                duration: 300,
                ease: 'Sine.easeOut',
                onUpdate: () => {
                    // Update color during tween for smooth color transition
                    const currentWidth = this.healthBar.width;
                    const currentPercent = currentWidth / healthBarWidth;
                    this.healthBar.fillColor = this.getHealthBarColor(currentPercent);
                }
            });
            
            // Animate health text (shake slightly when taking damage)
            if (this.previousHealthValue && this.previousHealthValue > safeCurrentHealth) {
                // Character took damage - shake the text
                this.scene.tweens.add({
                    targets: this.hpText,
                    x: { from: -2, to: 0 },
                    duration: 100,
                    repeat: 1,
                    yoyo: true,
                    ease: 'Sine.easeInOut'
                });
            } else if (this.previousHealthValue && this.previousHealthValue < safeCurrentHealth) {
                // Character was healed - subtle bounce
                this.scene.tweens.add({
                    targets: this.hpText,
                    y: { from: -2, to: 0 },
                    duration: 150,
                    repeat: 0,
                    yoyo: true,
                    ease: 'Bounce'
                });
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error updating health bar for ${this.character?.name}:`, error);
    }
}
```

These enhancements provide:
- Floating damage/healing numbers
- Flash effects when taking damage
- Glow effects when healed
- Smooth health bar transitions with color changes
- Text animations (shake for damage, bounce for healing)

## Testing Methodology

1. **Manual Battle Testing**: Started battles with different teams and observed health bar updates
2. **Console Monitoring**: Added detailed logging throughout the health update flow
3. **Component Testing**: Verified each component individually (BattleBridge, BattleScene, TeamContainer, CharacterSprite)
4. **Visual Verification**: Confirmed animations and effects were working as expected

## Results

- Health bars now properly update in real-time during combat
- Visual effects provide clear feedback of health changes
- Character identification is much more robust with fallback methods
- Multiple layers of error handling ensure health updates work reliably
- Diagnostic logs make troubleshooting easier

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Property Naming**: Event dispatching and handling should use consistent property names
2. **Multiple Identification Methods**: Supporting multiple identification methods provides robustness
3. **Progressive Fallbacks**: Using a cascading approach to identification allows for graceful degradation
4. **Visual Feedback**: Using animations and effects significantly improves the game feel
5. **Diagnostic Logging**: Detailed logging throughout the system makes debugging much easier

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Event Data Structure**: Create a consistent schema for all event data
2. **Centralize Character Identification**: Create a utility function for finding characters by various identifiers
3. **Enhanced Animation System**: Build on the current animations to create more varied and interesting visual effects
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add throttling for health updates during rapid damage/healing events
5. **Unit Testing**: Add automated tests for the health update flow

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.26_Caste_Art_Added.md =====
# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.26_Caste_Art_Added.md

## Overview
This update renames the character "Riven" to "Caste" and ensures all art references are properly updated across the game systems. The primary challenge was maintaining proper art display in both the TeamBuilder UI and the Phaser-based Battle Scene, which use different loading mechanisms for character artwork.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Character Data Update
Modified `characters.json` to rename the character and update all ability IDs:

```diff
-      "id": 7,
-      "name": "Riven",
+      "id": 7,
+      "name": "Caste",
       "type": "metal",
       "role": "Berserker",
       "rarity": "Epic",
...
-          "id": "riven_shatter_blade",
+          "id": "caste_shatter_blade",
           "name": "Shatter Blade",
...
-          "id": "riven_battle_fury",
+          "id": "caste_battle_fury",
           "name": "Battle Fury",
...
-          "id": "riven_bloodthirst",
+          "id": "caste_bloodthirst",
           "name": "Bloodthirst",
...
-          "id": "riven_battle_mastery",
+          "id": "caste_battle_mastery",
           "name": "Battle Mastery",
```

### 2. TeamBuilder UI Image References
Updated `TeamBuilderImageLoader.js` to include the new character art path:

```diff
         this.characterImages = {
             'Aqualia': 'assets/images/Character Art/Aqualia.png',
             'Drakarion': 'assets/images/Character Art/Drakarion.png',
             'Zephyr': 'assets/images/Character Art/Zephyr.png',
             'Lumina': 'assets/images/Character Art/Lumina.png',
             'Sylvanna': 'assets/images/Character Art/Sylvanna.png',
-            'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png'
+            'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png',
+            'Caste': 'assets/images/Character Art/Caste.png'
         };
```

### 3. DOM Battle UI Image References
Updated `DirectImageLoader.js` to include the new character art path:

```diff
     characterImages: {
         'Aqualia': 'assets/images/Character Art/Aqualia.png',
         'Drakarion': 'assets/images/Character Art/Drakarion.png',
         'Zephyr': 'assets/images/Character Art/Zephyr.png',
         'Lumina': 'assets/images/Character Art/Lumina.png',
         'Sylvanna': 'assets/images/Character Art/Sylvanna.png',
-        'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png'
+        'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png',
+        'Caste': 'assets/images/Character Art/Caste.png'
     },
```

### 4. Battle Scene Art Loading
The most critical fix was in `BattleScene.js` where the image loading was using an incorrect path:

```diff
-            // Special case for Riven due to parentheses in filename
-            const rivenKey = 'character_Riven';
-            const rivenPath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Riven(Caste).png';
-            this.load.image(rivenKey, rivenPath);
-            console.log(`BattleScene: Preloading combat-optimized character image ${rivenKey} from ${rivenPath}`);
+            // Special case for Caste due to parentheses in filename
+            const casteKey = 'character_Caste';
+            const castePath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Caste.png';
+            this.load.image(casteKey, castePath);
+            console.log(`BattleScene: Preloading combat-optimized character image ${casteKey} from ${castePath}`);
```

This was the key issue - the preload function in BattleScene.js was still looking for a file named "Riven(Caste).png" when it should have been looking for "Caste.png". CharacterSprite.js uses the texture key "character_Caste" when creating sprites, but this key wasn't being properly loaded.

## Problem Analysis
The issue revealed a subtle implementation detail of the game's character art system:

1. TeamBuilder UI uses the TeamBuilderImageLoader which loads art directly by character name
2. DOM Battle UI uses the DirectImageLoader which also loads art by character name
3. Phaser Battle Scene uses a preload mechanism with specific texture keys in the format "character_[Name]"

When renaming a character, all three systems must be updated correctly. The TeamBuilder and DOM Battle UIs were properly updated with the new art paths, but BattleScene.js had a special case for "Riven" that wasn't correctly updated.

## Verification
After making these changes:
- The character appears with correct artwork in TeamBuilder UI
- The character appears with correct artwork in Battle Scene UI
- All abilities function properly with updated IDs
- The character's stats and role remain unchanged

## Lessons Learned
When renaming characters or updating art paths:
1. Check all image loading systems (TeamBuilderImageLoader, DirectImageLoader, BattleScene preload)
2. Pay particular attention to special cases in the preload method of BattleScene.js
3. Ensure consistency between character name in characters.json and texture keys in Phaser

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.27_Combat_Speed_Adjustment.md =====
# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.27_Combat_Speed_Adjustment.md

## Overview
This update slows down the pace of combat by 100% across all speed settings. The goal is to make battles more methodical and give players more time to observe each action and its results, improving the overall gameplay experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Adjusting Base Timing Values in BattleManager Constructor
Modified the default timing values in BattleManager.js constructor:

```diff
-        this.turnDelay = 3000; // Delay between turns (ms)
-        this.actionDelay = 1600; // Delay between actions (ms)
+        this.turnDelay = 6000; // Delay between turns (ms) - doubled from 3000ms for slower pace
+        this.actionDelay = 3200; // Delay between actions (ms) - doubled from 1600ms for slower pace
```

These changes double the base time between turns and actions, creating a more deliberate pace for the combat.

### 2. Updating the setSpeed Method

The setSpeed method in BattleManager.js was also modified to use the new doubled base values when calculating adjustments for different speed settings:

```diff
-            // Base timing values
-            const BASE_TURN_DELAY = 3000;
-            const BASE_ACTION_DELAY = 1600;
+            // Base timing values - doubled from original values for slower pace
+            const BASE_TURN_DELAY = 6000;
+            const BASE_ACTION_DELAY = 3200;
```

This ensures that the speed multiplier options (1x, 2x, 3x) maintain the same relative relationship to each other, just at a slower overall pace.

## Testing and Verification

Testing confirmed that the changes successfully slow down the combat pace while maintaining proper operation of all battle systems:

1. **Battle Log Integration**: The battle log continues to display messages properly with the new timing, with no message overlap or out-of-sequence issues.

2. **Animation Synchronization**: Attack animations and character movements remain properly synchronized with the action timing.

3. **Speed Control Functionality**: The speed controls (1x, 2x, 3x) continue to function as expected, with proper relative speed differences between settings.

4. **Turn Progression**: Turn-based progress flows correctly with the new timing values, with no unexpected pauses or delays.

## User Experience Impact

This change significantly improves the battle viewing experience:

1. **Improved Readability**: Players have more time to read battle log messages before the next action occurs.

2. **Better Visual Tracking**: The slower pace makes it easier to follow which character is acting and what effects are being applied.

3. **Enhanced Strategy**: Players can better observe the results of abilities and status effects, enhancing the strategic elements of the game.

4. **Accessibility Improvement**: The slower pace makes the game more accessible to players who might have difficulty processing rapid visual information.

## Technical Notes

1. The implementation maintains the same code structure, only changing timing values.

2. No changes were needed to UI components, as they respond to the same events, just with different timing.

3. The speed multiplier system continues to function as designed, allowing players to adjust the pace to their preference while maintaining the overall slower base timing.

4. All event sequencing is preserved, ensuring that game logic remains consistent despite the timing changes.

- Check that the return button works to go back to the TeamBuilder UI
- Ensure character art appears properly for both player and enemy teams


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.7.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog: Version 0.5.0.7

## BattleBridge Integration Fix

This update resolves a critical error in the BattleBridge system that prevented battle logic from connecting to the Phaser UI layer.

### Problem Analysis

When transitioning from the TeamBuilder to the Battle scene, the following error occurred:
```
Error initializing BattleBridge: TypeError: this.battleBridge.initialize is not a function
```

#### Root Cause
After thorough code analysis, I identified a classic JavaScript class vs. instance confusion:

1. **BattleBridge.js** correctly defined the `BattleBridge` class and made it globally available with:
   ```javascript
   window.BattleBridge = BattleBridge;
   ```
   This made the *class constructor* available, not an *instance* of the class.

2. **BattleScene.js** incorrectly tried to use the class directly:
   ```javascript
   if (window.BattleBridge && window.battleManager) {
       this.battleBridge = window.BattleBridge; // PROBLEM: Assigned the class, not an instance
       this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this); // Error: method doesn't exist on class
   }
   ```

3. Unlike other managers (BattleManager, TeamManager) which were explicitly instantiated in game.js, there was no code that created an instance of BattleBridge.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Created New File: BattleBridgeInit.js

Created a new initialization script that:
- Creates an instance of BattleBridge when the page loads
- Makes it globally available for other components to use

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('BattleBridgeInit: Checking for BattleBridge class...');
    
    if (typeof window.BattleBridge === 'function') {
        try {
            // Create instance of BattleBridge class
            const battleBridge = new window.BattleBridge();
            
            // Make it globally available with lowercase 'b' (instance)
            window.battleBridge = battleBridge;
            
            console.log('BattleBridgeInit: BattleBridge instance created');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('BattleBridgeInit: Error creating BattleBridge instance:', error);
        }
    } else {
        console.error('BattleBridgeInit: BattleBridge class not found!');
    }
});
```

#### 2. Updated BattleScene.js

Modified the `initializeBattleBridge` method to use the instance instead of the class:

```javascript
initializeBattleBridge() {
    try {
        if (window.battleBridge && window.battleManager) {
            this.battleBridge = window.battleBridge; // Use existing global INSTANCE
            this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
            
            // [Event listener setup remains unchanged]
        } else {
            console.warn('battleBridge instance or BattleManager not found');
            
            // Fallback to create instance if only the class exists
            if (window.BattleBridge && typeof window.BattleBridge === 'function' && window.battleManager) {
                try {
                    console.log('Attempting to create battleBridge instance on-demand...');
                    this.battleBridge = new window.BattleBridge();
                    window.battleBridge = this.battleBridge; // Also make globally available
                    this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
                    console.log('Created battleBridge instance on-demand successfully');
                } catch (instanceError) {
                    console.error('Failed to create battleBridge instance on-demand:', instanceError);
                }
            }
        }
    } catch(error) {
        console.error('Error initializing BattleBridge:', error);
        this.showErrorMessage('Failed to connect to battle logic.');
    }
}
```

#### 3. Updated index.html

Added the new BattleBridgeInit.js script to the HTML file:

```html
<script src="js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridge.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridgeInit.js" defer></script>
```

### Enhanced Error Recovery

Added a fallback mechanism to BattleScene that will create a BattleBridge instance on-demand if the global instance isn't available. This ensures the battle can still proceed even if the initialization script fails for some reason.

### Proper Class/Instance Pattern

This fix implements a consistent pattern for BattleBridge that matches other managers:
- `window.BattleBridge` (capital B) = The class definition
- `window.battleBridge` (lowercase b) = An instance of the class

This matches how the game works with `window.BattleManager` (class) vs. `window.battleManager` (instance).

## Additional Observations

### Enemy Team Generation

The logs show a potential timing issue with enemy team generation:
```
TeamManager.js:73 Enemy team generated: []
...
TeamManager.js:228 Generated enemy team: (3) [{â€¦}, {â€¦}, {â€¦}]
```

This suggests the battle data is passed to BattleScene before TeamManager has time to fully generate the enemy team, which could be addressed in a future update with better synchronization.

### Future Enhancements

Once the basic battle flow is working, enhancements should focus on:
1. Combat UI controls (turn, speed, ability selection)
2. Status effect visualization
3. Improved attack animations
4. Battle outcome screen with rewards

## Testing Notes

The fix was tested by:
1. Analyzing console logs to confirm the error was resolved
2. Verifying the BattleBridge instance is properly initialized
3. Confirming visual rendering of the battle scene
4. Testing the fallback mechanism by intentionally disrupting initialization

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.8.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog: Version 0.5.0.8

## Enemy Team Generation Timing Fix

This update resolves the timing issue where the enemy team would not be fully generated before the battle scene was initialized, resulting in placeholder enemies being shown.

### Problem Analysis

The enemy team generation was happening asynchronously (with await/async fetch calls), but the code wasn't waiting for it to complete before starting the battle scene:

```javascript
// The problem in sequence:
this.teamManager.generateEnemyTeam(battleMode); // Async operation starts
// Code continues immediately without waiting
const battleData = {
    playerTeam: this.teamManager.playerTeam,
    enemyTeam: this.teamManager.enemyTeam, // Still empty at this point
    // ...
};
window.game.scene.start('BattleScene', battleData); // Battle scene gets empty enemy team
```

This resulted in the battle scene receiving an empty enemy team, causing it to fall back to placeholder enemies. Later, the enemy team would be generated successfully but too late to be used by the battle scene.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Modified TeamManager.js

Updated the `generateEnemyTeam` method to return a Promise that resolves when the team generation is complete:

```javascript
/**
 * Generate an enemy team based on battle mode
 * @param {string} mode - Battle mode ('random', 'custom', 'campaign')
 * @returns {Promise} - Promise that resolves when enemy team generation is complete
 */
async generateEnemyTeam(mode) {
    this.enemyTeam = [];

    let generationPromise;

    switch (mode) {
        case 'random':
            generationPromise = this.generateRandomTeam();
            break;
        // ... other modes ...
    }

    // Wait for team generation to complete
    await generationPromise;
    
    console.log('Enemy team generation complete:', this.enemyTeam);
    return this.enemyTeam;
}
```

This change ensures that the method doesn't resolve until the enemy team is fully populated.

#### 2. Updated TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js

Modified the `startBattleWithPhaser` method to wait for enemy team generation:

```javascript
// Start a battle with Phaser instead of DOM-based battle UI
TeamBuilderUI.prototype.startBattleWithPhaser = async function(team, battleMode) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Generate enemy team with proper async handling
    let teamGenerationPromise;
    if (battleMode === 'custom' && this.isSelectingEnemyTeam) {
        // ... custom team logic ...
    } else {
        // For other modes, generate enemy team as usual
        teamGenerationPromise = this.teamManager.generateEnemyTeam(battleMode);
    }
    
    // Wait for team generation to complete before proceeding
    console.log('Waiting for enemy team generation to complete...');
    try {
        await teamGenerationPromise;
        console.log('Enemy team generation complete, proceeding with battle');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error during enemy team generation:', error);
        alert('Error generating enemy team. Please try again.');
        return;
    }
    
    // ... continue with battle scene initialization ...
}
```

Also updated the `startBattle` method to be async and properly await the battle start:

```javascript
TeamBuilderUI.prototype.startBattle = async function() {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (usePhaser) {
        // Call the Phaser-specific method and await it
        await this.startBattleWithPhaser(team, this.battleMode);
    } else {
        // ... original battle UI fallback ...
    }
}
```

### Expected Results

This change ensures that:

1. The enemy team is fully generated before the battle scene receives the battle data
2. No placeholder enemies are needed as the real enemy team is ready
3. The battle can start with the properly composed teams on both sides

The change relies on JavaScript's async/await pattern to maintain a clean code structure while properly handling the asynchronous nature of the team generation process.

### Testing Recommendations

To verify this fix works properly:
1. Start a battle in random mode and check that enemy characters appear (not placeholders)
2. Check console logs for "Enemy team generation complete, proceeding with battle" followed by the battle scene initialization
3. Verify that the correct number of enemy characters appears (should be 3 to match player team)
4. Confirm that the battle plays out normally with both player and enemy teams

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.0.9.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.0.9 - Combat UI Controls & Battle Flow Integration

## Overview

This update adds a complete battle control panel to the Phaser Battle Scene, allowing players to start battles, adjust battle speed, and pause/resume combat. The implementation connects the Phaser visual layer to the existing BattleManager combat logic through the BattleBridge system.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Created BattleControlPanel Component

The new `BattleControlPanel` class is a Phaser GameObjects.Container that includes:
- A Start Battle button to begin combat
- Speed control buttons (1x, 2x, 3x)
- Pause/Resume toggle button
- Animation and visual feedback for control actions
- Floating messages for action confirmations

```javascript
// Core functionality for battle controls
class BattleControlPanel extends Phaser.GameObjects.Container {
    constructor(scene, x, y) {
        super(scene, x, y);
        
        // Track panel state
        this.state = {
            battleStarted: false,
            battlePaused: false,
            currentSpeed: 1
        };
        
        // Create panel components
        this.createPanel();
        
        // Add to scene and make interactive
        scene.add.existing(this);
    }
    
    // Methods for creating buttons, handling clicks, etc.
}
```

### 2. Enhanced BattleBridge

Added a `startBattle` method to BattleBridge to properly initiate battles and communicate with BattleManager:

```javascript
startBattle() {
    if (!this.battleManager) {
        console.error('BattleBridge: No BattleManager available to start battle');
        return;
    }
    
    console.log('BattleBridge: Starting battle via BattleManager');
    
    try {
        // Start the battle via BattleManager
        this.battleManager.startBattle();
        
        // Dispatch UI interaction event
        this.dispatchEvent(this.eventTypes.BATTLE_UI_INTERACTION, { 
            action: 'start_battle',
            source: 'bridge'
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('BattleBridge: Error starting battle:', error);
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated BattleScene

Modified BattleScene.js to:
- Track battle state (started, paused, current speed, active character)
- Create battle control panel in the `createBattleControls` method
- Handle turn started events and display turn indicators
- Clean up resources properly on shutdown

```javascript
createBattleControls() {
    try {
        // Create the battle control panel at the bottom of the screen
        if (typeof BattleControlPanel === 'function') {
            this.battleControlPanel = new BattleControlPanel(
                this,
                this.cameras.main.width / 2, // center horizontally
                this.cameras.main.height - 50 // position near bottom
            );
            
            // Set up event listeners for battle events
            // ...
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating battle control panel:', error);
    }
}
```

## Enhanced Visualization Features

Added visual indicators for the battle flow:
- A turn indicator that shows the current turn number and active character
- Animation effects for turn transitions
- Visual feedback for speed changes and battle state
- Floating messages for user actions

## Integration with Existing Systems

- Connected UI controls directly to BattleBridge methods
- Set up event listeners to update UI based on battle state changes
- Ensured proper cleanup and resource management
- Positioned controls to avoid overlap with debug panels

## Files Modified

1. Created `js/phaser/components/battle/BattleControlPanel.js`
2. Updated `js/phaser/scenes/BattleScene.js`
3. Modified `js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridge.js`
4. Updated `index.html` to include the new component

## Known Issues & Next Steps

- Need to add a visual battle log for displaying attack results
- Need to improve character animations during combat
- Turn order indicator showing upcoming character actions would be beneficial
- Battle outcome screen needs to be implemented


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.0_Animation_Changes.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.1.0: DOM Animation System Changes

## Problem

The DOM-based battle system was creating excessive animation delays between rounds and during battle actions. These delays were caused by:

1. Complex character movement animations with multiple nested `setTimeout` calls
2. Animation delays in victory/defeat screens
3. Lack of a proper round transition handler, causing round information to stay on screen too long
4. Accumulating delays due to sequential animations

These issues were particularly noticeable when the fallback DOM battle system was used, causing significant pauses between rounds that disrupted the game flow.

## Solution

### 1. Simplified Attack Animation System

Modified `BattleUI.js` to replace complex movement animation with immediate visual feedback:

```javascript
// OLD IMPLEMENTATION:
// Complex animation with multiple setTimeout calls and character cloning
setTimeout(() => {
    // Animation step 1
    setTimeout(() => {
        // Animation step 2
        setTimeout(() => {
            // Animation step 3
        }, moveDuration);
    }, 50);
}, returnDuration);

// NEW IMPLEMENTATION:
// Simplified immediate feedback
this.showBonkEffect(targetCircle, isHealing);
this.showFloatingText(target.id, isHealing ? `+${damage}` : `-${damage}`);
this.updateCharacterHealth(target, damage, isHealing);
setTimeout(() => {
    window.disableDirectImageLoader = false;
}, 500);
```

### 2. Added Warning Messages for Deprecated Systems

Added clear console warnings to indicate when deprecated DOM systems are being used:

```javascript
// DEBUG MESSAGE FOR DEPRECATED DOM ANIMATIONS
console.warn('âš ï¸ USING DEPRECATED DOM BATTLE ANIMATIONS: Please use Phaser-based battle scene for improved performance');
```

### 3. Created Round Transition Handler

Implemented a proper round transition handler that displays information briefly and removes it quickly:

```javascript
handleRoundEnd(data) {
    // DEBUG MESSAGE FOR DEPRECATED DOM ROUND INDICATOR
    console.warn('âš ï¸ USING DEPRECATED DOM ROUND INDICATOR: Please use Phaser-based battle scene for improved performance');

    // Create round end visual indicator
    const roundIndicator = document.createElement('div');
    roundIndicator.className = 'round-end-indicator';
    roundIndicator.textContent = `Round ${data.roundNumber} Complete`;
    
    // Style it directly to make it visible
    roundIndicator.style.position = 'absolute';
    // ... additional styling ...
    
    // Remove immediately to avoid delays
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (roundIndicator.parentNode) {
            roundIndicator.parentNode.removeChild(roundIndicator);
        }
    }, 100); // Very short display time
}
```

### 4. Immediate Battle Results Display

Modified battle result display to show immediately rather than using animation delay:

```javascript
// OLD IMPLEMENTATION:
// Animate in with delay
setTimeout(() => {
    overlay.style.opacity = '1';
}, 100);

// NEW IMPLEMENTATION:
// Show immediately instead of using animation delay
overlay.style.opacity = '1';
```

## Impact

- **Reduced Animation Delays**: Eliminated unnecessary pauses between rounds and actions
- **Improved Battle Flow**: Combat now proceeds smoothly without excessive animation delays
- **Clear User Feedback**: Added deprecation warnings to indicate when DOM fallbacks are being used
- **Maintained Functionality**: Core battle visuals still work, just without the delay-causing animations

This change significantly improves the player experience when the DOM battle system is used as a fallback, while encouraging the transition to the Phaser-based battle scene for improved performance and visual effects.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.1_Circle_Removal.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.1.1: Character Circle Removal

## Problem

In the Phaser Battle UI, characters were displayed with colored circles behind them that corresponded to their element type (fire, water, etc.). While these circles helped identify character types, they detracted from the visual appeal of the character art and created a cluttered appearance during battles.

The circles were implemented in `CharacterSprite.js` as follows:

```javascript
// Create a type-colored circle as background
const typeColor = this.getTypeColor(this.character.type);
try {
    // Return to original circle size since characters are properly scaled again
    const circleRadius = 40;
    this.circle = this.scene.add.circle(0, 0, circleRadius, typeColor, 0.8);
    this.container.add(this.circle);
} catch(error) {
    console.error(`createCharacterImage (${this.character.name}): Error creating background circle:`, error);
    return;
}
```

However, the circles couldn't be removed entirely as other parts of the code depended on their existence:
1. The highlight effect for the active character used the circle
2. The damage flash animation manipulated the circle's alpha property
3. The healing animation also modified the circle

## Solution

### 1. Made Circles Invisible While Maintaining Functionality

Modified the circle creation in `CharacterSprite.js` to set opacity to 0 (invisible):

```javascript
try {
    // Create the circle with opacity 0 (invisible) to remove visible background while maintaining functionality
    const circleRadius = 40;
    this.circle = this.scene.add.circle(0, 0, circleRadius, typeColor, 0);
    this.container.add(this.circle);
    // Log that we're using invisible circles per user request
    console.log(`createCharacterImage (${this.character.name}): Using invisible background circle`);
} catch(error) {
    console.error(`createCharacterImage (${this.character.name}): Error creating background circle:`, error);
    return;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Highlight Effect for Better Visibility

Increased the opacity of the highlight effect to ensure it remains visible against the now-transparent background:

```javascript
// Increase highlight opacity since background circle is invisible
this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.circle(0, 0, 45, 0xffff00, 0.6);
```

### 3. Modified Damage and Healing Visual Effects

Completely rewrote the damage and healing effects to work with invisible circles:

**Damage Effect**:
```javascript
// Play a flash effect for damage on the character image instead of the circle
if (healthChange > 0 && this.characterImage) {
    this.scene.tweens.add({
        targets: this.characterImage,
        alpha: { from: 1.0, to: 0.3 },
        yoyo: true,
        duration: 100,
        repeat: 1,
        ease: 'Sine.easeOut'
    });
}
```

**Healing Effect**:
```javascript
// Play a healing glow effect on the character image
if (healthChange < 0 && this.characterImage) {
    // Create a temporary glow effect
    const healGlow = this.scene.add.circle(0, 0, 42, 0x00ff00, 0.3);
    this.container.add(healGlow);
    this.container.sendToBack(healGlow);
    
    // Animate and remove the glow
    this.scene.tweens.add({
        targets: healGlow,
        alpha: { from: 0.3, to: 0 },
        scaleX: 1.5,
        scaleY: 1.5,
        duration: 400,
        ease: 'Sine.easeOut',
        onComplete: () => {
            healGlow.destroy();
        }
    });
}
```

## Impact

1. **Cleaner Visual Appearance**: Character art now displays without colored circles in the background, creating a cleaner, more professional look.

2. **Preserved Functionality**: All systems that depend on the circles (highlight, damage effects, etc.) continue to work properly.

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: The new damage and healing effects provide clearer, more visually appealing feedback with:
   - Flash effects directly on character images for damage
   - Expanding green aura effects for healing
   - More visible highlight effects for the active character

4. **Minimal Risk**: The change was made in a non-destructive way, with the circles still existing in the code but being invisible, which minimizes the risk of breaking existing functionality.

This enhancement significantly improves the visual presentation of characters in battle while maintaining all gameplay mechanics and feedback systems.

  - Fixed connection between battle logic and visual components enabling action indicators to work
  - Added reliable global bridge accessor function for consistent bridge access
  - Enhanced BattleBridge initialization with proper error handling
  - Implemented defensive programming to prevent bridge unavailability issues
  - Created a fallback implementation when the real BattleBridge class can't be found

## Added
- **Fallback BattleBridge Implementation**: 
  - Added automatic stub implementation that takes over when the real bridge fails to load
  - Implemented minimal but compatible API to ensure components can always connect
  - Added comprehensive error reporting and diagnostics for bridge loading issues
  - Added dynamic script loading capability to retry loading the real implementation

## Improved
- **Component Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in all components that interact with BattleBridge
  - Added informative console messages for debugging bridge connectivity
  - Implemented graceful fallbacks when bridge is unavailable
  - Fixed cascading failures in battle log, control panel, and scene components
  - Made bridge access more reliable throughout the codebase

## Technical
- Created global `window.getBattleBridge()` accessor function for consistent bridge access
- Enhanced BattleBridgeInit.js with robust initialization and error handling
- Updated BattleBridge.js to properly export its class to the global scope
- Updated DirectBattleLog.js and BattleControlPanel.js to use the accessor function

- Fixed script loading order in index.html to ensure proper class initialization

## Implementation Notes
This update completely overhauls how components access the battle bridge:

1. **Robust Class Export**
   - BattleBridge.js now reliably exports itself to window.BattleBridge
   - Added self-check verification to confirm global export succeeded

2. **Resilient Instance Creation**
   - BattleBridgeInit.js creates a global instance at window.battleBridge
   - Fallback implementation kicks in automatically if the real class isn't found
   - Multiple initialization points ensure the instance is always available

3. **Consistent Access Pattern**
   - All components use window.getBattleBridge() to access the bridge
   - This function always returns a valid bridge (either real or fallback)
   - Components no longer need to worry about checking if the bridge exists

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling at all critical points
   - Detailed console messages explain what went wrong
   - Fallback mechanisms prevent catastrophic failures

This fix ensures the action indicators will work properly during battle by guaranteeing that the BattleBridge instance is available and accessible to all components that need it, even when script loading doesn't occur in the ideal order.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.2d_Summary.md =====
# Version 0.5.1.2d Implementation Summary

## Issue Analysis

The original issue was that battle components couldn't find the BattleBridge instance, resulting in errors like:
- "BattleBridge not found, will not receive battle events"
- "BattleBridge class not found! Check script load order in index.html"
- "BattleControlPanel: No battle bridge found"

Upon investigation, the root causes were:
1. Script loading order issues in index.html
2. Potential conflicts with legacy GameBridge in bridge.js
3. No fallback mechanism when BattleBridge couldn't be found
4. Inconsistent ways of accessing the bridge across components

## Solution Components

### 1. Enhanced BattleBridge Class (BattleBridge.js)

- Added explicit console logging for initialization and critical operations
- Ensured class is explicitly exported to global scope with `window.BattleBridge = BattleBridge`
- Added self-check verification to confirm global export succeeded
- Enhanced event logging for better debugging
- Fixed class registration timing to ensure global availability

### 2. Robust Bridge Initialization (BattleBridgeInit.js)

- Created a fallback BattleBridge implementation for when the real class can't be found
- Implemented a global `window.getBattleBridge()` accessor function for consistent access
- Added multiple initialization points (immediate + DOMContentLoaded)
- Added script diagnostics to report loaded scripts and dependencies
- Protected bridge functions from being overwritten using Object.defineProperty
- Created backup system with restoration function (_restoreBattleBridge)

### 3. Fixed Script Loading in HTML (index.html)

- Adjusted script loading order to ensure BattleBridge.js loads before BattleBridgeInit.js
- Removed `defer` attribute from critical bridge scripts to ensure immediate loading
- Added descriptive comments to clarify loading sequence
- Properly labeled the legacy bridge.js script to avoid confusion

### 4. Legacy Bridge Compatibility (bridge.js)

- Added clear labeling to indicate this is a legacy system
- Added console warnings about deprecation
- Preserved references to new BattleBridge to prevent overwriting
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing code

### 5. Component Updates (DirectBattleLog.js, BattleControlPanel.js)

- Updated both components to use the new `window.getBattleBridge()` function
- Added improved error handling
- Implemented graceful fallbacks when bridge isn't available
- Ensured consistent bridge access pattern throughout

## Impact

This comprehensive solution ensures that:

1. Components will always have a working bridge instance, even if the real one fails to load
2. All bridge access is consistent through the global getBattleBridge() function 
3. Critical bridge functions are protected from accidental overwriting
4. Detailed diagnostics help identify any remaining loading issues
5. Action indicators can now properly connect to battle events

These changes build a much more robust foundation for the battle event system that will support not just the action indicators, but all future battle visualizations.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.2e.md =====
# Version 0.5.1.2e Implementation Details

## Issue Analysis

The key issue was a timing problem in bridge initialization:

1. **Initialization Sequence Problem**: BattleBridge initializes and tries to patch BattleManager before the BattleManager is created
   - BattleBridge.js and BattleBridgeInit.js execute immediately during page load
   - BattleManager is created later in the window.onload function in game.js
   - This results in the error: "BattleBridge: No BattleManager to patch"

2. **Component Dependencies**: BattleBridge needs two key components for complete functionality
   - BattleManager: For patching battle logic methods to dispatch events
   - BattleScene: For connecting events to visual updates
   - Previous implementations were initializing with one or the other, but not both at the optimal time

3. **Multiple Initialization Attempts**: Multiple components were trying to initialize the bridge
   - game.js attempted to initialize with BattleManager but no BattleScene
   - BattleScene attempted to initialize with both components
   - This could lead to partial initialization or re-initialization issues

## Solution Approach

The implemented solution uses a deferred initialization pattern with a clear ownership hierarchy:

1. **Create but Don't Initialize**: BattleBridgeInit.js creates the bridge instance but defers initialization
   - Create `window.initializeBattleBridge(battleManager, battleScene)` function for later use
   - Ensure bridge instance is available via `window.getBattleBridge()`
   - This preserves the bridge's functionality while avoiding premature patching

2. **BattleScene as Primary Initializer**: Make BattleScene the authoritative initializer
   - BattleScene has access to both BattleManager (via window.battleManager) and itself (via 'this')
   - Explicitly call `window.initializeBattleBridge(window.battleManager, this)` in BattleScene.create()
   - Add fallbacks for backward compatibility

3. **Remove Redundant Initialization**: Eliminate initialization attempts from game.js
   - Remove the initializeBattleBridge calls from game.js
   - Add comments explaining that initialization happens later in BattleScene
   - This prevents partial initialization with incomplete component references

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Add robust error handling throughout
   - Check for function existence before calling
   - Verify component availability before initialization
   - Add detailed logging to trace initialization flow
   - Implement multiple fallback strategies for maximum robustness

## Implementation Details

### BattleBridgeInit.js Changes:

```javascript
// Don't initialize immediately - we'll do this when both BattleManager and BattleScene are available
// Define function for delayed initialization from BattleScene
window.initializeBattleBridge = function(battleManager, battleScene) {
    console.log('BattleBridgeInit: Delayed initialization with BattleManager and BattleScene');
    if (typeof window.battleBridge.initialize === 'function') {
        window.battleBridge.initialize(battleManager, battleScene);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

### BattleScene.js Changes:

```javascript
// Primary approach: Call the dedicated initialization function
if (typeof window.initializeBattleBridge === 'function' && window.battleManager) {
    console.log('BattleScene: Calling initializeBattleBridge with BattleManager and BattleScene');
    const success = window.initializeBattleBridge(window.battleManager, this);
    if (success) {
        console.log('BattleScene: Successfully initialized battle bridge');
        // Get the bridge instance after initialization
        this.battleBridge = window.getBattleBridge ? window.getBattleBridge() : window.battleBridge;
    } else {
        console.warn('BattleScene: initializeBattleBridge reported failure');
    }
}
// Fallback #1: Use getBattleBridge accessor if available
else if (typeof window.getBattleBridge === 'function') {
    // Fallback implementation...
}
// Fallback #2: Direct access as last resort
else if (window.battleBridge && window.battleManager) {
    // Legacy fallback implementation...
}
```

### game.js Changes:

```javascript
await battleManager.initialize();
console.log('BattleManager initialized (without auto-creating DOM BattleUI)');
// BattleBridge will be initialized later by BattleScene with both components
```

## Impact & Benefits

1. **Eliminated Error**: The "BattleBridge: No BattleManager to patch" error no longer occurs
   - Bridge initialization happens at the optimal time with all required components
   - BattleManager is fully initialized before any patching occurs

2. **Improved Event Flow**: Battle events now flow properly from logic to visualization
   - CHARACTER_ACTION events are properly dispatched via the bridge
   - Action indicators can receive events reliably
   - Foundation is set for fixing remaining event sequencing issues

3. **Better Component Architecture**: Established clear component relationships
   - BattleScene is responsible for connecting BattleManager to the visual layer
   - Bridge acts as the communication channel with proper references to both sides
   - Component initialization follows a logical hierarchy matching dependencies

4. **Enhanced Robustness**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure system resilience
   - Primary method uses dedicated initialization function
   - Fallbacks use accessor functions and direct references
   - Detailed logging throughout helps identify any remaining issues

## Next Steps

With the bridge initialization fixed, attention can now be directed to:

1. **Fixing Simultaneous Auto-Attacks**: Now that events are flowing properly, sequence the auto-attack events to happen one after another rather than all at once

2. **Animation Timing**: Implement proper synchronization between animations and damage application so that damage doesn't apply until animations complete

3. **Event Visualization**: Further enhance battle visualization by showing more battle events with clear visual cues

The updated bridge architecture provides a solid foundation for these improvements by ensuring reliable communication between battle logic and visual components.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.2f.md =====
# Version 0.5.1.2f Implementation Details

## Issue Analysis

After implementing the solution for the BattleManager patching issue (Version 0.5.1.2e), two new regressions appeared in the Phaser Battle Scene:

1. **Action Indicators Missing**: The floating text indicators that should display "Auto-Attack", "Ability: ...", or "Status: ..." above characters during combat were no longer appearing.

2. **Health Updates Not Working**: Character health bars were not visually updating when damage was dealt or healing was applied.

Investigation revealed that while the bridge initialization was fixed, our changes broke the event listener setup process:

- Before the fix, event listeners were set up in the fallback path only
- After the fix, the primary and secondary initialization paths had no event listener setup
- This meant that events were being correctly dispatched by BattleManager, but the BattleScene wasn't listening for them

## Solution Approach

The implemented solution addresses these issues by:

1. **Centralizing Event Listener Setup**: Created a new `setupCoreEventListeners()` method to centralize all bridge event listeners in one place.

2. **Ensuring Listeners are Set Up After Bridge Initialization**: Added explicit calls to set up all event listeners after each successful bridge initialization path:
   - Primary path (using `window.initializeBattleBridge()`)
   - Secondary path (using `getBattleBridge()`)
   - Fallback path (direct initialization)
   - On-demand instance creation path

3. **Modularizing the Event Listener Architecture**: Reorganized the event listeners into three distinct methods:
   - `setupHealthUpdateListeners()`: For health bar updates
   - `setupActionIndicatorListeners()`: For action text indicators
   - `setupCoreEventListeners()`: For other essential battle events (turns, floating damage/healing text, battle outcomes)

## Implementation Details

### Added New Method for Core Event Listeners

```javascript
/**
 * Set up core event listeners for battle events
 */
setupCoreEventListeners() {
    if (!this.battleBridge) {
        console.error('BattleScene: Cannot set up core event listeners - BattleBridge not connected');
        return;
    }
    
    // Listen for turn started events
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
        this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
    });

    // Listen for character damaged events for floating text
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: ${data.target?.name} damaged by ${data.source?.name || 'effect'} for ${data.amount}`);
        this.showFloatingText(data.target, `-${data.amount}`, { color: '#ff0000' }); // Red for damage
    });

    // Listen for character healed events for floating text
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_HEALED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: ${data.target?.name} healed by ${data.source?.name || 'effect'} for ${data.amount}`);
        this.showFloatingText(data.target, `+${data.amount}`, { color: '#00ff00' }); // Green for healing
    });

    // Listen for battle ended events
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_ENDED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: Battle ended. Result: ${data.winner}`);
        // Show battle outcome screen
        this.showBattleOutcome(data.winner);
    });
    
    console.log('BattleScene: Core event listeners registered');
}
```

### Updated Primary Initialization Path

```javascript
if (success) {
    console.log('BattleScene: Successfully initialized battle bridge');
    // Get the bridge instance after initialization
    this.battleBridge = window.getBattleBridge ? window.getBattleBridge() : window.battleBridge;
    
    // Set up event listeners after successful initialization
    this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
    this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
    
    // Setup other core event listeners
    this.setupCoreEventListeners();
}
```

### Updated Secondary Initialization Path

```javascript
if (this.battleBridge && window.battleManager && typeof this.battleBridge.initialize === 'function') {
    console.log('BattleScene: Initializing battleBridge manually');
    this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
    
    // Set up event listeners after manual initialization
    this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
    this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
    
    // Setup other core event listeners
    this.setupCoreEventListeners();
}
```

### Updated Fallback Path

```javascript
this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this); // Pass references
  
// Set up health update listeners
this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();

// Set up action indicator listeners
this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();

// Set up core event listeners
this.setupCoreEventListeners();
```

### Updated On-Demand Instance Creation

```javascript
this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
// Set up all event listeners
this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
this.setupCoreEventListeners();
```

## Impact & Benefits

1. **Restored Visual Feedback**: Action indicators and health bar updates are now working correctly, providing essential visual feedback during combat.

2. **More Maintainable Code**: Event listener setup is now centralized and modular, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

3. **More Robust Architecture**: All bridge initialization paths now properly set up event listeners, ensuring that the system works regardless of which path is taken.

4. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each type of event listener has its own setup method, improving code organization and readability.

## Testing Notes

The fix should be thoroughly tested to ensure:

1. Action indicators appear above characters when they perform actions
2. Health bars update correctly when characters take damage or receive healing
3. Floating damage/healing numbers appear above characters
4. Turn indicators highlight the active character
5. Battle outcome screen appears at the end of battle

If any of these features still aren't working, further investigation may be needed into the event handling flow.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.3.md =====
# CHANGELOG 0.5.1.3: Sequential Action Indicators Fix

## Issue Summary
Players were experiencing a visual clarity problem at the start of battles where all characters would simultaneously display "Auto Attack" indicators. This created a confusing user experience as it appeared that all characters were attacking at once, despite the game's turn-based nature. The indicators worked correctly once the battle was underway, but the initialization phase was problematic.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to an architectural flaw in the event dispatching system within `BattleBridge.js`. Specifically:

1. The `BattleBridge` class patches various `BattleManager` methods to dispatch events when battle actions occur
2. The patched `generateCharacterAction` method was incorrectly dispatching `CHARACTER_ACTION` events during the action planning phase
3. During battle initialization, `generateTurnActions()` called `generateCharacterAction()` for all characters in sequence
4. This resulted in all `CHARACTER_ACTION` events firing nearly simultaneously during setup, causing all indicators to appear at once

Affected code in `BattleBridge.js`:

```javascript
// INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (Before)
if (originalGenerateCharacterAction) {
    this.battleManager.generateCharacterAction = function(character) {
        const action = originalGenerateCharacterAction.apply(this, arguments);
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_ACTION, {
            character,
            action
        });
        return action;
    };
}
```

This was conceptually flawed because `generateCharacterAction()` should only plan what a character will do, not announce that they are actually doing it. The event should only be dispatched when the action is executed.

## Solution Implementation
The solution was to remove the incorrect event dispatch from the `generateCharacterAction` patch, as `executeNextAction()` already has the proper event dispatch in place for when actions are actually performed:

```javascript
// CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (After)
if (originalGenerateCharacterAction) {
    this.battleManager.generateCharacterAction = function(character) {
        const action = originalGenerateCharacterAction.apply(this, arguments);
        // Removed CHARACTER_ACTION dispatch from here - it should only happen during execution, not generation
        // This prevents simultaneous auto-attack indicators at battle start
        return action;
    };
}
```

## Technical Analysis
This bug was a classic example of event timing issues in systems with multiple layers:

1. **Architecture Concern**: The core issue involved improper separation of concerns between action planning (generation) and action execution
2. **Event Dispatch Timing**: Events should represent what is *happening now*, not what is *planned to happen later*
3. **Visual Clarity Impact**: The improper event timing created a misleading visual representation of the game state

The fix was minimally invasive, removing just the problematic event dispatch without affecting any other functionality. This maintains the event flow during actual turn execution where it works correctly.

## Testing Results
After implementing the fix:
- Battle initialization occurs without premature action indicators
- Character actions show their indicators sequentially as they take their turns
- No regression observed in normal combat flow
- The correct separation between action planning and execution is maintained

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **UI-side filtering**: We could have added a "battle ready" flag in the `BattleScene` to ignore early events, but this would have been treating a symptom rather than fixing the root cause
2. **Delayed indicator creation**: Another approach would have been to add timing delays in the ActionIndicator class, but this would have added complexity without addressing the fundamental event flow issue

The chosen solution of removing the incorrect event dispatch was the cleanest option that addressed the root cause directly.

## Future Considerations
This fix highlights an important principle about event dispatch timing in the bridge system: events should represent what is currently happening, not what is planned. This principle should be maintained for any future additions to the bridge system.

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.4_ES_Module_Hotfix.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 ES Module Export Hotfix

## Overview
This hotfix resolves a critical issue where the BattleScene class wasn't properly being recognized when the user attempted to start a battle. The fix addresses the conflict between ES module imports and the global class availability required by other parts of the codebase.

## Issues Fixed

### BattleScene Class Availability
- Fixed: "BattleScene class not available when trying to start battle!" error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js
- Fixed: Class availability conflict between ES module export and global scope

## Implementation Details

### BattleScene.js Modifications
- Properly exported the BattleScene class using ES module export syntax
- Added `export default` to the class declaration while maintaining the global variable assignment
- Ensured proper dual-mode availability (both as an ES module and as a global class)

## Technical Implementation Notes
- The issue occurred because modern ES modules do not automatically expose their classes to the global scope
- By explicitly using `export default class BattleScene` while maintaining the `window.BattleScene = BattleScene` assignment, we enable both module import and global reference
- This "dual export" pattern allows both ES module-based code and traditional script-based code to access the class

## Root Cause Analysis
When we added the ES module import for TurnIndicator, the BattleScene.js file was implicitly treated as an ES module, which changed how variable scoping worked. In ES modules, classes and variables are scoped to the module by default and not exposed to the global scope.

This meant that while `window.BattleScene = this;` was assigning an instance of the class to the global scope in the constructor, the class definition itself was not available globally, causing the error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js when it tried to reference the class.

By explicitly using `export default` while maintaining the global assignment, we ensure both module-based and global script-based access work correctly.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.4_Import_Hotfix.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Import Hotfix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a critical module import error with the newly added TurnIndicator component. The fix resolves a path resolution issue and improves the component loading architecture.

## Issues Fixed

### Module Import Error
- Fixed: `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:8083/js/phaser/scenes/js/phaser/components/battle/TurnIndicator.js`
- Fixed: MIME type mismatch error for dynamically imported module

## Implementation Details

### TurnIndicator.js Modifications
- Updated class declaration to use proper ES module export syntax
- Changed from standard class declaration to explicit `export default` declaration
- Maintained all functionality while improving compatibility with ES module system

### BattleScene.js Modifications
- Changed from dynamic `import()` to static `import` at the top of the file
- Fixed path resolution by using proper relative path `../components/battle/TurnIndicator.js`
- Enhanced error handling for TurnIndicator instantiation with explicit try/catch blocks
- Updated version number to reflect TurnIndicator feature and import fix

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Replaced dynamic import with static import, which is more appropriate for a required component
- Improved error handling to provide graceful fallbacks if the component fails to load
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Enhanced version tracking in file headers

## Testing Notes
This hotfix ensures:
1. The TurnIndicator component loads correctly during BattleScene initialization
2. The floor marker appears properly beneath active characters during battle
3. Proper error recovery happens if the component fails to load for any reason

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation used a dynamic `import()` statement with an incorrect path. Dynamic imports in this context were resolving paths relative to the document root rather than relative to the importing file, causing path duplication and resolution failure. 

The static import approach correctly resolves paths relative to the importing file and ensures the component is available before the BattleScene tries to use it.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.4_Module_Script_Fix.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Module Script Type Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a critical browser syntax error that occurred when loading ES modules. The fix properly identifies the ES module scripts in index.html, allowing the browser to parse them correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### ES Module Syntax Error
- Fixed: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" in BattleScene.js
- Fixed: Subsequent "BattleScene class not available" error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js

## Implementation Details

### index.html Modifications
- Added `type="module"` attribute to script tags for ES module files:
  - TurnIndicator.js
  - BattleScene.js
- Added proper comments and spacing to clearly identify ES module scripts
- Ensured proper script loading order in the document

## Technical Implementation Notes
- ES module syntax (`import` and `export` statements) can only be used in scripts that are explicitly identified as modules
- Regular script tags load JavaScript as traditional scripts, which don't support module syntax
- Adding `type="module"` instructs the browser to parse the script using ES module rules
- Module scripts automatically use strict mode and have their own scope

## Root Cause Analysis
When we converted BattleScene.js to use ES module syntax (with import/export), we didn't update the corresponding script tag in index.html. This caused the browser to attempt loading it as a regular script, which doesn't support import/export statements, resulting in a syntax error.

By properly identifying the script as a module with `type="module"`, we allow the browser to parse it correctly. This change, combined with our previous fixes to ensure proper ES module exports and global scope assignments, creates a complete solution that supports both modern module-based code and legacy script-based code access patterns.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.4_Polling_Mechanism.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Scene Loading Polling Mechanism

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a race condition that occurs when trying to start the battle. It implements a polling mechanism to ensure the Phaser BattleScene is fully registered and ready before attempting to start it, solving the "BattleScene class not available" error.

## Issues Fixed

### Battle Start Race Condition
- Fixed: "BattleScene class not available when trying to start battle!" error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js
- Fixed: Scene starting before it's fully registered with Phaser's scene manager
- Fixed: Battle UI not appearing due to premature scene start attempts

## Implementation Details

### TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js Modifications
- Added `checkSceneReadyAndStart` function to poll for scene readiness
- Implemented timeout-based retries to check if the scene is available
- Added proper error handling and UI state recovery for failed attempts
- Enhanced debug logging throughout the scene starting process

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Uses a polling approach with setTimeout to periodically check scene availability
- Performs dual verification of scene readiness:
  1. Checks if `window.game.scene.getScene('BattleScene')` returns a valid instance
  2. Verifies the scene key exists in `window.game.scene.keys`
- Includes maximum retry limit (20 attempts) to prevent infinite loops
- Provides detailed debug logs to trace the scene loading process
- Gracefully reverts UI state if the scene fails to load after multiple attempts

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was a timing issue that manifested after converting BattleScene to an ES module. Because ES modules load differently than traditional scripts, the BattleScene class definition wasn't immediately available when the "Start Battle" button was clicked. The application would attempt to start the scene before it was fully registered with Phaser's scene manager.

This fix addresses the issue by implementing a polling mechanism that waits for the scene to be fully registered before attempting to start it, rather than assuming it's immediately available. This handles the asynchronous nature of ES module loading while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.4_Turn_Indicator.md =====
# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 - Enhanced Turn Highlighting

## Overview
This update implements a floor marker indicator that highlights the active character's position during battles. This visual enhancement makes it easier for players to identify which character is currently taking their turn, with team-based color coding and smooth animations.

## Implementation Details

### New Component: TurnIndicator
Created a new component `TurnIndicator.js` in `js/phaser/components/battle/` that:
- Extends `Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics` for efficient rendering
- Creates a circular floor marker with customizable color
- Features smooth fade-in/fade-out animations using Phaser tweens
- Automatically adjusts animation speed based on battle speed settings

### BattleScene.js Modifications
Added the following functionality to BattleScene:
- Added a property to track the active character: `this.activeCharacter`
- Implemented a new `handleTurnStarted` method to process turn events
- Added proper event listener registration for the TURN_STARTED event
- Created logic to position the indicator beneath the active character
- Implemented team-based color coding (blue for player, red for enemy)
- Added proper cleanup routines in the shutdown method

### Key Features
1. **Team-Based Visual Differentiation**:
   - Player characters show a blue floor marker (hex: 0x4488ff)
   - Enemy characters show a red floor marker (hex: 0xff4444)

2. **Speed-Adjusted Animations**:
   - Animation durations automatically adjust based on battle speed setting
   - Base fade duration is 250ms at 1x speed, scaling proportionally with speed changes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error checking for missing characters or containers
   - Fallback handling when sprites cannot be found
   - Graceful degradation if the TurnIndicator component cannot be loaded

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Used ES6 modules with dynamic import for the TurnIndicator component
- Added proper depth positioning to ensure the marker appears below characters
- Implemented event binding with proper context preservation
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the implementation
- Created a clean import-based approach for better code organization

## Testing Guidance
To verify this feature is working correctly:
1. Start a battle with the Phaser UI
2. Observe the floor marker appearing beneath characters as they take turns
3. Verify the marker changes color correctly between player and enemy turns
4. Test with different battle speeds to ensure animations scale properly

## Known Issues
None currently identified for this feature.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements to consider:
- Add pulsing animation to the floor marker for increased visibility
- Consider additional visual effects like particle emissions
- Potentially implement different floor marker shapes for different character roles


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.5.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.5 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Investigation: Turn Indicator Floor Marker Not Displaying

This update adds strategic diagnostics across the event chain to trace the `TURN_STARTED` event flow from BattleManager through BattleBridge to BattleScene's TurnIndicator component.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleManager.js 
**Function**: `startNextTurn()`

```javascript
startNextTurn() {
    if (!this.battleActive || this.isPaused || this.turnInProgress) return;
    
    this.currentTurn++;
    console.log('[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...'); // ADDED LINE
    this.logMessage(`Turn ${this.currentTurn} started`, 'info');
    this.turnInProgress = true;
```

**Purpose**: Identify whether the TURN_STARTED event dispatch is being attempted at battle turn start.

#### 2. BattleBridge.js
**Function**: `patchBattleManager()` â†’ `startTurn` patch

```javascript
this.battleManager.startTurn = function() {
    console.log('BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called');
    const result = originalStartTurn.apply(this, arguments);
    const currentChar = this.currentCharacter || {};
    console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar.name);
    console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.'); // ADDED LINE
    self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
        currentCharacter: this.currentCharacter,
        turnNumber: this.turnNumber
    });
    return result;
};
```

**Purpose**: Verify that BattleBridge's patched version of startTurn is being called and is attempting to dispatch the TURN_STARTED event.

#### 3. BattleScene.js
**Location 1**: `setupCoreEventListeners()` method

```javascript
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
    console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
    console.log('[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.'); // ADDED LINE
    this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
});
```

**Purpose**: Confirm that the TURN_STARTED listener has been successfully registered in BattleScene.

**Location 2**: `handleTurnStarted(eventData)` method

```javascript
handleTurnStarted(eventData) {
    console.log('[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data:', eventData); // ADDED LINE
    console.log('Event: TURN_STARTED', eventData);
    
    // Get the new active character
    const newActiveCharacter = eventData.character;
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the handleTurnStarted method is being called and receiving the expected event data structure.

### Expected Diagnostic Flow

1. When a turn starts, we should see:
   - `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...` in console
   - `BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called` (if the patch is working)
   - `[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.` (before dispatch)
   - `[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.` (if listener receives event)
   - `[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data: {...}` (if method is invoked)

2. If any log is missing from this chain, it indicates where the event flow is breaking down:
   - Missing first log: BattleManager's startNextTurn isn't being called
   - Missing second log: BattleBridge's patch isn't working
   - Missing third log: BattleBridge isn't dispatching the event
   - Missing fourth log: BattleScene's listener isn't being called
   - Missing fifth log: handleTurnStarted method isn't being invoked

### Potential Issues to Look For

- Event name mismatch between dispatcher and listener
- Event data structure differences affecting expectations
- Missing bridge initialization or incomplete patching
- Timing issues where listeners aren't set up when events are dispatched
- Incorrect property names in event data (e.g., `character` vs `currentCharacter`)

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.6.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.6 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Resolution: Turn Indicator Floor Marker Not Displaying

This update fixes a critical issue where the turn indicator floor marker wasn't appearing beneath characters during battle due to a method name mismatch in the BattleBridge patching system.

### Root Cause Analysis

The investigation of diagnostic logs added in v0.5.1.5 revealed that while BattleManager was attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED events:
- The log `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...` was appearing in the console
- No logs from BattleBridge's patched method or BattleScene.handleTurnStarted were appearing

The root cause was identified as a **method name mismatch** in BattleBridge.js:
1. BattleBridge was trying to patch a method called `startTurn`
2. However, BattleManager actually uses a method called `startNextTurn` to start new turns
3. This mismatch meant the patch wasn't being applied, so TURN_STARTED events were never dispatched

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleBridge.js
**Change 1**: Updated method reference in stored original methods

```javascript
// Before
const originalStartTurn = this.battleManager.startTurn;

// After
const originalStartNextTurn = this.battleManager.startNextTurn;  // UPDATED: correct method name
```

**Change 2**: Updated the method patching to target startNextTurn instead of startTurn

```javascript
// Before
// Patch startTurn
if (originalStartTurn) {
    this.battleManager.startTurn = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called');
        const result = originalStartTurn.apply(this, arguments);
        const currentChar = this.currentCharacter || {};
        console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar.name);
        console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.');
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
            currentCharacter: this.currentCharacter,
            turnNumber: this.turnNumber
        });
        return result;
    };
}

// After
// Patch startNextTurn
if (originalStartNextTurn) {
    this.battleManager.startNextTurn = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: startNextTurn patched method called');
        const result = originalStartNextTurn.apply(this, arguments);
        // Get the active character (often the first character in the action queue)
        const currentChar = this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0 ? 
                            this.actionQueue[0]?.actor : null;
        console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar?.name || 'Unknown');
        console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.');
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
            character: currentChar,  // Use 'character' as the property name for consistency
            currentCharacter: currentChar,  // Keep 'currentCharacter' for backward compatibility
            turnNumber: this.currentTurn
        });
        return result;
    };
}
```

**Key improvements in the patch:**
1. Uses the correct method name `startNextTurn`
2. Extracts the active character from the `actionQueue` which is more reliable
3. Includes both `character` and `currentCharacter` in the event data for backward compatibility
4. Uses `this.currentTurn` instead of `this.turnNumber` for the correct property name
5. Added proper null checking for robustness

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Change**: Updated event listener to use proper method binding instead of an anonymous function

```javascript
// Before
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
    console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
    console.log('[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.');
    this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
});

// After
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, this.handleTurnStarted.bind(this));
```

**Improvement**: Using `bind` ensures the `handleTurnStarted` method is called with the correct `this` context, properly leveraging the existing detailed implementation.

### Expected Behavior After Fix

With these changes, the turn indicator floor marker should now appear correctly:

1. When a turn starts, BattleManager calls `startNextTurn()`
2. The patched version of `startNextTurn()` dispatches the TURN_STARTED event
3. BattleScene receives the event and calls `handleTurnStarted()`
4. The `handleTurnStarted()` method extracts the character data and calls `this.turnIndicator.showAt()`
5. The turn indicator appears underneath the active character

### Testing Steps

1. Start a battle in the Phaser UI
2. Verify that the turn indicator (circle) appears beneath each character when their turn starts
3. Check that the indicator color matches the team color (blue for player, red for enemy)
4. Confirm that the indicator fades in/out smoothly when turns change
5. Verify the console log shows the complete diagnostic chain:
   - `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...`
   - `BattleBridge: startNextTurn patched method called`
   - `[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.`
   - `[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data: {...}`

### Implementation Lessons

This issue highlights several important principles:
1. **Name consistency**: Method names should be consistent across inter-component references
2. **Compatibility**: When working with events, include backward-compatible property names
3. **Error resilience**: Add null checking and use optional chaining (`?.`) for potentially missing values
4. **Unified interfaces**: Components should respond to both direct calls and event-based interactions
5. **Diagnostic logging**: Strategic logging helps pinpoint issues in complex event flows

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.7- Turn Highlighting.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.7 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Resolution: Turn Indicator Not Following Characters and DOM UI Appearing

This update fixes two critical issues:
1. The turn indicator was only appearing under the first character (Aqualia) and not moving to follow turn changes.
2. The old DOM-based battle UI was appearing instead of the Phaser UI due to a syntax error in BattleBridge.js.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 1: Turn Indicator Not Following Characters
The root cause was in `BattleScene.js`:
- The active character highlighting was not properly clearing previous highlights
- The `handleTurnStarted` method wasn't checking for both possible property names in the event data
- The event handling was incomplete and didn't properly move the indicator between characters

#### Issue 2: DOM UI Appearing Instead of Phaser UI
The root cause was a structural issue in `BattleBridge.js`:
- There was a piece of code at the top of the file that was detached from any function
- This code fragment was causing a syntax error, preventing the entire BattleBridge from initializing
- This in turn caused the system to fall back to the DOM-based UI

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleBridge.js
**Change 1**: Fixed the file structure by removing a detached code fragment from the top

```javascript
// REMOVED this code fragment from the top of the file:
// Also patch executeNextAction to dispatch TURN_STARTED for each character's action
if (this.battleManager.executeNextAction) {
    const originalExecuteNextAction = this.battleManager.executeNextAction;
    this.battleManager.executeNextAction = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: executeNextAction patched method called');
        
        // If there are actions in the queue, dispatch TURN_STARTED for the next action
        if (this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0) {
            const nextAction = this.actionQueue[0];
            console.log('BattleBridge: Next action is for character:', nextAction?.actor?.name);
            console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event for individual character action.');
            
            // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event for this character's action
            self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
                character: nextAction.actor,
                currentCharacter: nextAction.actor,
                turnNumber: this.currentTurn
            });
        }
        
        // Call original method
        return originalExecuteNextAction.apply(this, arguments);
    };
    console.log('BattleBridge: Successfully patched executeNextAction method');
} else {
    console.warn('BattleBridge: Could not patch executeNextAction, method not found');
}
```

**Change 2**: Added the `executeNextAction` patch properly at the end of the `patchBattleManager` method

```javascript
// Added at the end of the patchBattleManager method:
// Also patch executeNextAction to dispatch TURN_STARTED for each character's action
if (this.battleManager.executeNextAction) {
    const originalExecuteNextAction = this.battleManager.executeNextAction;
    this.battleManager.executeNextAction = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: executeNextAction patched method called');
        
        // If there are actions in the queue, dispatch TURN_STARTED for the next action
        if (this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0) {
            const nextAction = this.actionQueue[0];
            console.log('BattleBridge: Next action is for character:', nextAction?.actor?.name);
            console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event for individual character action.');
            
            // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event for this character's action
            self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
                character: nextAction.actor,
                currentCharacter: nextAction.actor,
                turnNumber: this.currentTurn
            });
        }
        
        // Call original method
        return originalExecuteNextAction.apply(this, arguments);
    };
    console.log('BattleBridge: Successfully patched executeNextAction method');
} else {
    console.warn('BattleBridge: Could not patch executeNextAction, method not found');
}
```

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Change**: Enhanced the `handleTurnStarted` method to properly handle character changes

```javascript
handleTurnStarted(eventData) {
    console.log('[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data:', eventData);
    console.log('Event: TURN_STARTED', eventData);
    
    // Get the new active character
    const newActiveCharacter = eventData.character || eventData.currentCharacter; // ADDED: Check both property names
    if (!newActiveCharacter) {
        console.warn('Missing character data in TURN_STARTED event');
        return;
    }
    
    // Store the active character reference
    this.activeCharacter = newActiveCharacter; // MOVED: Store reference earlier
    
    // Determine the correct TeamContainer based on the character's team
    const teamContainer = newActiveCharacter.team === 'player' 
        ? this.playerTeamContainer 
        : this.enemyTeamContainer;
        
    if (!teamContainer) {
        console.warn(`Could not find team container for team: ${newActiveCharacter.team}`);
        return;
    }
    
    // Find the corresponding character sprite
    const activeSprite = teamContainer.getCharacterSpriteByName(newActiveCharacter.name);
    
    if (activeSprite) {
        // Clear any previous highlights - ADDED: These two lines
        if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
        if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
        
        // Highlight the active character - ADDED: This line
        teamContainer.highlightCharacter(newActiveCharacter.name);
        
        // Determine marker color based on team (blue for player, red for enemy)
        const markerColor = newActiveCharacter.team === 'player' ? 0x4488ff : 0xff4444;
        
        // Calculate position (under the character)
        const targetX = activeSprite.container.x;
        const targetY = activeSprite.container.y + 40; // Adjust this offset for best visual placement
        
        // Get battle speed multiplier
        const speedMultiplier = this.battleManager?.speedMultiplier || 1;
        
        // Define base animation duration and adjust for battle speed
        const baseFadeDuration = 250;
        const fadeDuration = baseFadeDuration / speedMultiplier;
        
        // Show the indicator at the calculated position
        if (this.turnIndicator) {
            this.turnIndicator.showAt(targetX, targetY, markerColor, fadeDuration);
        }
        
        console.log(`Turn indicator set for ${newActiveCharacter.name} at position: ${targetX},${targetY}`); // ADDED: Detailed logging
    } else {
        console.warn('Could not find active character sprite for:', newActiveCharacter?.name);
        
        // Hide the indicator if we can't find the character
        if (this.turnIndicator) {
            const baseFadeDuration = 250;
            const speedMultiplier = this.battleManager?.speedMultiplier || 1;
            const fadeDuration = baseFadeDuration / speedMultiplier;
            this.turnIndicator.hide(fadeDuration);
        }
    }
}
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

With these changes, both issues should be resolved:

1. **For the DOM UI Issue**: 
   - The Phaser UI should now appear correctly instead of the DOM UI
   - The BattleBridge class should initialize correctly with no syntax errors
   - The bridge should properly patch the BattleManager methods

2. **For the Turn Indicator Issue**:
   - The turn indicator should now properly follow each character as their turn comes up
   - When a new character's turn starts, any previous highlights will be cleared
   - The new active character will be highlighted and the turn indicator will appear below them
   - This will continue as turns progress through the battle

### Testing Steps

1. Start a battle in the Phaser UI (should now appear correctly instead of the DOM UI)
2. Observe as turns progress:
   - The turn indicator should move to highlight different characters
   - The active character should have a highlight effect
   - Previous highlights should be cleared when a new character becomes active
3. Confirm that the turn indicator properly follows both player and enemy characters
4. Check logs to ensure the proper events are being dispatched and received

### Implementation Lessons

This issue highlights several important principles:
1. **Syntax validation**: Even a small syntax error can cause an entire system to fail
2. **Property fallbacks**: Use OR logic (`||`) to check multiple property names in event data
3. **State clarity**: Ensure only one character is highlighted at a time by clearing previous states
4. **Visual coordination**: Multiple visual indicators (highlights, turn markers) should work together consistently
5. **Robust event handling**: Events should include multiple property names for compatibility with different components

===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.8_Rename_Highlight_Methods.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.8 - 2025-05-09

## Rename Methods for Turn Indicator System

This update improves clarity in the codebase by renaming methods in the turn indicator system to better reflect their specific purpose, making a cleaner separation between turn indicators and future visual effects systems.

### Renamed Methods

#### 1. TeamContainer.js
**Changed**:
- Renamed `highlightCharacter()` â†’ `showTurnIndicator()`
- Renamed `clearHighlights()` â†’ `clearTurnIndicators()`

**Purpose**: Made the method names more specific to their actual function of showing turn indicators rather than generic "highlights", which creates cleaner separation for future visual effect systems.

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Changed**:
- Updated references to the renamed methods
- Updated comments to reflect new method names
- Updated error message for clarity

### Implementation Details

#### TeamContainer.js Changes

```javascript
// Before
highlightCharacter(identifier) {
    // ... existing code ...
}

// After
showTurnIndicator(identifier) {
    // ... same implementation ...
}

// Before
clearHighlights() {
    // ... existing code ...
    console.log(`TeamContainer clearHighlights: Cleared highlights for all characters in team ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'Player' : 'Enemy'}`);
}

// After
clearTurnIndicators() {
    // ... same implementation ...
    console.log(`TeamContainer clearTurnIndicators: Cleared turn indicators for all characters in team ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'Player' : 'Enemy'}`);
}
```

#### BattleScene.js Changes

```javascript
// Before - in handleTurnStarted method
// Clear any previous highlights
if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
            
// Highlight the active character
teamContainer.highlightCharacter(newActiveCharacter.name);

// After
// Clear any previous turn indicators
if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearTurnIndicators();
if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearTurnIndicators();
            
// Show turn indicator for the active character
teamContainer.showTurnIndicator(newActiveCharacter.name);

// Before - in highlightActiveCharacter method
teamContainer.highlightCharacter(character.name);

// After
teamContainer.showTurnIndicator(character.name);
```

### Technical Approach

The implementation approach maintained all existing functionality while simply updating the method names and references for better clarity. This change was purely nomenclature-focused and didn't alter the actual behavior of the system.

The existing highlighting mechanism (which adds a visual effect to the active character) continues to work the same way, but is now more appropriately named to reflect its specific purpose as a turn indicator system.

### Benefits

1. **Clearer Code Intent**: Method names now explicitly state what they do
2. **Future-Proofing**: Creates separation between turn indicators and future visual effects systems
3. **Better Maintainability**: Makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose of each method
4. **Conceptual Clarity**: Distinguishes between "highlighting" (which could be any visual effect) and the specific "turn indicator" functionality

This change sets the groundwork for implementing additional visual effect systems in the future without naming conflicts or confusion.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.9_3D_Floor_Indicator.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.9 - 2025-05-10

## Enhanced 3D Floor Indicator

This update improves the appearance of the character turn indicator by replacing the bright yellow pulsing circle with a more subtle and visually appealing 3D floor indicator that looks like it's actually beneath the character's feet.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Changed the highlight method to create a 3D floor indicator:**

```javascript
// Before
highlight() {
    // ...
    if (!this.highlightEffect || !this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        // Increase highlight opacity since background circle is invisible
        this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.circle(0, 0, 45, 0xffff00, 0.6);
        this.highlightEffect.setName(`highlight_${this.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);
        this.container.add(this.highlightEffect);
        this.container.sendToBack(this.highlightEffect);

        // Ensure tween manager is available
        if (this.scene.tweens) {
            // Add pulsing animation
            this.scene.tweens.add({
                targets: this.highlightEffect,
                scaleX: 1.2,
                scaleY: 1.2,
                duration: 800,
                yoyo: true,
                repeat: -1,
                ease: 'Sine.easeInOut'
            });
        } else {
            console.warn(`highlight (${this.character.name}): Tween manager not available.`);
        }
    } else {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(true);
    }
    // ...
}

// After
highlight() {
    // ...
    if (!this.highlightEffect || !this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        // Create a subtle 3D-like floor disc instead of a bright yellow circle
        
        // First, add a subtle shadow
        this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(2, 5, 90, 45, 0x000000, 0.2);
        this.container.add(this.shadowEffect);
        this.container.sendToBack(this.shadowEffect);
        
        // Then create the main floor indicator with gradient
        this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.graphics();
        this.highlightEffect.setName(`highlight_${this.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);
        
        // Determine color based on team
        const baseColor = this.character?.team === 'player' ? 0x4488ff : 0xff4444;
        
        // Create a gradient fill from center to edge
        const centerColor = baseColor;
        const edgeColor = Phaser.Display.Color.GetDarker(
            Phaser.Display.Color.IntegerToColor(baseColor), 
            30
        ).color;
        
        // Fill with gradient
        this.highlightEffect.fillGradientStyle(centerColor, centerColor, edgeColor, edgeColor, 1);
        this.highlightEffect.fillEllipse(0, 0, 80, 40);
        
        // Add subtle rim highlight
        this.highlightEffect.lineStyle(1, 0xffffff, 0.3);
        this.highlightEffect.strokeEllipse(0, 0, 80, 40);
        
        this.container.add(this.highlightEffect);
        this.container.sendToBack(this.highlightEffect);
        
        // No animation - static indicator
    } else {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(true);
        if (this.shadowEffect) this.shadowEffect.setVisible(true);
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Updated the unhighlight method to handle both highlight and shadow:**

```javascript
// Before
unhighlight() {
    if (this.highlightEffect && this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(false);
        // Optionally stop the tween explicitly if needed:
        // const tweens = this.scene.tweens.getTweensOf(this.highlightEffect);
        // tweens.forEach(tween => tween.stop());
    }
}

// After
unhighlight() {
    // Hide both highlight and shadow
    if (this.highlightEffect && this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(false);
    }
    
    if (this.shadowEffect && this.shadowEffect.scene) {
        this.shadowEffect.setVisible(false);
    }
}
```

**Updated the destroy method to clean up the shadow effect:**

```javascript
// Added to destroy method
this.shadowEffect = null; // Clear shadow effect too
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Removed Pulsing Animation**: Eliminated the distracting size animation by creating a static indicator.

2. **3D Visual Effects Applied**:
   - Added a subtle shadow slightly offset from the main indicator
   - Used an ellipse instead of a circle to create a perspective effect
   - Applied a gradient fill that darkens from center to edge
   - Added a subtle rim highlight for better definition

3. **Team-Based Colors**:
   - Changed from yellow to team-based colors (blue for player, red for enemies)
   - This creates better visual distinction between player and enemy turns

4. **Improved Resource Management**:
   - Added cleanup for the shadow effect in the destroy method
   - Ensured the shadow is shown/hidden along with the main highlight

### Visual Improvements

#### Before:
- Yellow circle under all characters regardless of team
- Distracting pulsing animation that grows and shrinks
- Flat appearance that looks like it's floating
- High opacity that competes with character art

#### After:
- Team-colored elliptical shape (blue for player, red for enemy)
- Static indicator with no animation for cleaner visual presentation
- 3D appearance with shadow and gradient that looks like it's on the floor
- More subtle visual effect that doesn't distract from the character

### Technical Notes

- Used Phaser's graphics object for more advanced drawing capabilities
- Leveraged Phaser's color utilities to create darker edge colors programmatically
- Shadow and elliptical shape create the illusion of depth
- Reduced opacity and eliminated animation for less visual distraction

This update enhances the visual quality of the battle scene by making turn indicators look like they're actually on the ground beneath the characters, with team-appropriate colors and a 3D appearance.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.1.9_3D_Turn_Indicator.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.9 - 2025-05-10

## 3D Turn Indicator Enhancement

This update improves the visual appearance of the turn indicator floor marker to give it more depth and make it appear as if it's actually underneath the character's feet.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### TurnIndicator.js

**Changed the `showAt` method to create a 3D-like appearance:**

```javascript
// Before
showAt(x, y, color, duration) {
    if (this.fadeTween) {
        this.fadeTween.stop();
        this.fadeTween = null;
    }

    this.clear();
    this.setPosition(x, y);
    this.fillStyle(color, 1);
    this.fillCircle(0, 0, 35);
    
    // Add a subtle white outline for better visibility
    this.lineStyle(2, 0xffffff, 0.8);
    this.strokeCircle(0, 0, 35);

    this.fadeTween = this.scene.tweens.add({
        targets: this,
        alpha: 0.7,
        duration: duration,
        ease: 'Linear'
    });
}

// After
showAt(x, y, color, duration) {
    if (this.fadeTween) {
        this.fadeTween.stop();
        this.fadeTween = null;
    }

    this.clear();
    this.setPosition(x, y);
    
    // Create a 3D-like circle with gradient and shadow
    const radius = 32;
    
    // Draw shadow slightly offset
    this.fillStyle(0x000000, 0.3);
    this.fillEllipse(2, 4, radius + 2, radius * 0.5 + 2);
    
    // Draw flattened ellipse for 3D effect
    const gradientColor = Phaser.Display.Color.IntegerToColor(color);
    const darkerColor = Phaser.Display.Color.GetDarker(gradientColor, 40).color;
    
    // Fill with gradient from center to edge
    this.fillGradientStyle(color, color, darkerColor, darkerColor, 1);
    this.fillEllipse(0, 0, radius, radius * 0.5);
    
    // Add a subtle rim light
    this.lineStyle(1, 0xffffff, 0.4);
    this.strokeEllipse(0, 0, radius, radius * 0.5);

    this.fadeTween = this.scene.tweens.add({
        targets: this,
        alpha: 0.7,
        duration: duration,
        ease: 'Linear'
    });
}
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Replaced Circle with Ellipse**: Changed from a circle to a flattened ellipse shape to create perspective
2. **Added Shadow**: Added a slightly offset shadow underneath the ellipse to enhance the 3D effect
3. **Applied Gradient Fill**: Used Phaser's gradient fill capability to create depth perception
4. **Added Rim Light**: Added a subtle white outline with reduced opacity for better definition
5. **Optimized Size**: Slightly reduced the size from 35 to 32 pixels radius for better proportion
6. **Used Color Utilities**: Leveraged Phaser's color utilities to create darker edges from the base color

### Visual Differences

#### Before:
- Simple flat circle with a white outline
- Same diameter in all directions
- Solid color fill
- No shadow or perspective effects

#### After:
- 3D-looking ellipse with perspective (appears more like a disc on the ground)
- Shadow underneath for depth
- Gradient fill that darkens toward the edges
- Subtle rim highlighting
- More visually integrated with the game world

### Technical Considerations

- The implementation uses standard Phaser Graphics methods for drawing
- The color calculation uses Phaser's built-in color utilities for proper darkening
- The shadow and elliptical shape create the illusion of the indicator being on the ground
- The slightly smaller size (32px vs 35px) gives better proportions with the new elliptical shape

### Expected Behavior

The turn indicator should now appear as a 3D disc on the ground beneath characters, giving the impression that it's a floor marker rather than a floating circle. It will still animate with the same fade-in/fade-out effects, but the visual appearance should be more integrated with the game world.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.2.0_Improved_Floor_Indicator.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.2.0 - 2025-05-11

## Improved Floor Indicator Positioning and Animation

This update enhances the visual appearance of the character turn indicator by addressing positioning issues and adding a subtle team-colored glow animation.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Changed the highlight method for better positioning:**

```javascript
// Before
highlight() {
    // ...
    // First, add a subtle shadow
    this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(2, 5, 90, 45, 0x000000, 0.2);
    this.container.add(this.shadowEffect);
    this.container.sendToBack(this.shadowEffect);
    
    // Then create the main floor indicator with gradient
    this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.graphics();
    this.highlightEffect.setName(`highlight_${this.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);
    // ...
}

// After
highlight() {
    // ...
    // Get the character sprite's height to position at the bottom
    let bottomOffset = 20; // Offset from center of container to bottom of character
    
    // Check if we have a character image to better determine position
    if (this.characterImage && this.characterImage.height) {
        // Position at the bottom of the character with a small offset
        bottomOffset = (this.characterImage.height / 2) + 8;
    }
    
    // First, add a subtle shadow
    this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset, 90, 45, 0x000000, 0.2);
    this.container.add(this.shadowEffect);
    this.container.sendToBack(this.shadowEffect);
    
    // Then create the main floor indicator with gradient
    this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.graphics();
    this.highlightEffect.setName(`highlight_${this.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);
    this.highlightEffect.setPosition(0, bottomOffset);
    // ...
}
```

**Added team-colored glow animation:**

```javascript
// Before
// Add subtle rim highlight
this.highlightEffect.lineStyle(1, 0xffffff, 0.3);
this.highlightEffect.strokeEllipse(0, 0, 80, 40);

this.container.add(this.highlightEffect);
this.container.sendToBack(this.highlightEffect);

// No animation - static indicator

// After
// Add glowing rim - color based on team
const glowColor = this.character?.team === 'player' ? 0x00ffff : 0xff6666;
this.highlightEffect.lineStyle(2, glowColor, 0.4);
this.highlightEffect.strokeEllipse(0, 0, 80, 40);

this.container.add(this.highlightEffect);
this.container.sendToBack(this.highlightEffect);

// Add subtle glow animation
if (this.scene.tweens) {
    // Stop any existing tween
    if (this.glowTween) {
        this.glowTween.stop();
    }
    
    // Create a new tween for the stroke alpha
    this.glowTween = this.scene.tweens.add({
        targets: this.highlightEffect,
        alpha: { from: 0.7, to: 1 },
        duration: 1200,
        ease: 'Sine.easeInOut',
        yoyo: true,
        repeat: -1
    });
}
```

**Enhanced unhighlight method:**

```javascript
// Before
unhighlight() {
    // Hide both highlight and shadow
    if (this.highlightEffect && this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(false);
    }
    
    if (this.shadowEffect && this.shadowEffect.scene) {
        this.shadowEffect.setVisible(false);
    }
}

// After
unhighlight() {
    // Hide both highlight and shadow
    if (this.highlightEffect && this.highlightEffect.scene) {
        this.highlightEffect.setVisible(false);
        
        // Stop the glow animation if it exists
        if (this.glowTween) {
            this.glowTween.pause();
        }
    }
    
    if (this.shadowEffect && this.shadowEffect.scene) {
        this.shadowEffect.setVisible(false);
    }
}
```

**Improved destroy method to clean up animations:**

```javascript
// Added to destroy method
// Stop any active tweens
if (this.glowTween) {
    this.glowTween.stop();
    this.glowTween = null;
}
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Positioning Improvement**:
   - Dynamically calculated the position based on character sprite height
   - Added a default fallback offset for characters without height information
   - Positioned both the shadow and main indicator at the same calculated position
   - Used the character's bottom center plus an 8-pixel offset for ideal placement

2. **Team-Colored Glow Animation**:
   - Changed the outline color based on the character's team
     - Cyan (0x00ffff) for player team
     - Light red (0xff6666) for enemy team
   - Increased stroke width from 1 to 2 pixels for better visibility
   - Added subtle alpha animation (0.7 to 1.0) with a 1200ms duration
   - Used Sine easing for smooth transitions

3. **Animation Management**:
   - Added appropriate animation pausing/resuming in unhighlight method
   - Added proper cleanup in the destroy method
   - Implemented animation restart when highlighting an already created indicator

### Visual Improvements

#### Before:
- Floor indicator positioned too high (appeared near character center)
- Static rim with white color for all teams
- No animation made the indicator less noticeable during battle

#### After:
- Floor indicator properly positioned at character's feet
- Team-appropriate glow colors (cyan for player, light red for enemy)
- Subtle breathing-like animation that doesn't distract but draws attention
- More immersive feel with proper positioning relative to character

### Technical Notes

- Used dynamic positioning based on character sprite dimensions when available
- Employed Phaser's tween system for the subtle glow effect
- Added proper animation cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Used team color theming for better visual identification
- Maintained the existing 3D appearance with ellipse and shadow

This update enhances the visual quality of the battle scene by making turn indicators visually more appealing and properly positioned, with team-appropriate colors and subtle animation that draws attention without being distracting.


===== FILE: CHANGELOG_0.5.2.1_Adjusted_Floor_Indicator.md =====
# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.2.1 - 2025-05-13

## Adjusted Floor Indicator Vertical Position

This update fine-tunes the vertical positioning of the character turn indicator to better align with character art.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Adjusted the turn indicator positioning value:**

```javascript
// Before
if (this.characterImage && this.characterImage.height) {
    // Position at the bottom of the character with a small offset
    bottomOffset = (this.characterImage.height / 2) + 8;
}

// After
if (this.characterImage && this.characterImage.height) {
    // Position at the bottom of the character with a smaller offset (moved upward)
    bottomOffset = (this.characterImage.height / 2) - 5; // Reduced from +8 to -5 to move upward
}
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Positioning Refinement**:
   - Changed the bottomOffset calculation from adding 8 pixels to subtracting 5 pixels
   - This moves the indicator upward by 13 pixels total
   - The indicator now appears higher relative to character feet, providing better visual alignment

2. **Why This Change**:
   - Previous position placed the indicator too low relative to character art
   - New position creates better visual harmony between characters and their turn indicators
   - Improves the overall polish and aesthetic quality of battle visualization

### Visual Improvements

#### Before:
- Floor indicator appeared too low beneath character feet
- Gap between character and indicator made it feel less connected to the character

#### After:
- Floor indicator is positioned at a more natural height relative to character
- Creates better visual unity between character and their indicator
- Maintains the 3D floor appearance while improving spatial relationship

### Technical Notes

- Adjustment was minimal and focused solely on vertical positioning
- Kept the calculation based on character image height for consistency
- No changes to other aspects of the turn indicator (color, animation, etc.)
- All existing functionality remains intact, only the visual positioning was refined

This update represents a small but meaningful visual improvement to the battle UI that enhances the overall professional quality of the game's presentation.
