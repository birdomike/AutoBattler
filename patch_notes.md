# Patch Notes - Battle Log Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Fixed reference error in DirectBattleLog.js: "ReferenceError: messagesToShow is not defined"
- Error occurred in the renderMessages() method (line ~597) because variables were defined in try blocks but used outside their scope

## Changes Made
1. Modified variable declarations in `renderMessages()` method:
   - Ensured all critical variables (`messagesToShow`, `messageHeights`, `totalHeightNeeded`, `totalHeight`) are declared at the function scope level
   - Removed redeclarations of these variables in try blocks that were causing scope issues
   - Changed redeclarations to reassignments using existing variables
   
2. Added improved code comments:
   - Clarified variable initialization purpose
   - Added defensive programming notes
   - Improved explanation of variable scope management

## Files Modified
- `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\js\phaser\components\battle\DirectBattleLog.js`

## Testing
- Created a test HTML file to verify the battle log functions correctly
- Confirmed the reference error no longer occurs when rendering messages
- Tested with animations to ensure full functionality

## Technical Details
The main issue was variable scope management. Variables declared with `let` in JavaScript have block scope, meaning they're only accessible within the block (typically within curly braces) where they're defined. The original code was declaring the same variables multiple times in different try blocks, but then trying to use them outside those blocks.

The fix ensures all variables are declared at the function level scope, making them accessible throughout the entire function regardless of which try/catch blocks are executed.
