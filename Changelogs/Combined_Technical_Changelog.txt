===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.13_TeamSlotArtPositionFix =====

# Changelog: Team Slot Art Position Fix with Transform

## Version 0.6.7.13 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update resolves a persistent issue with character art positioning in team slots. While previous fixes (0.6.7.11 and 0.6.7.12) resolved visibility and attempted to address positioning, the character images still appeared too low in their slots. This version implements a more robust positioning solution using CSS transforms.

### Technical Problem Analysis
Previous attempts at positioning the character art relied on adjusting the `top` and `left` properties of the artwork itself:

```css
.slot-content .hero-avatar-container .team-builder-art {
    position: absolute;
    top: -25px; 
    left: -15px;
    /* other properties */
}
```

Browser testing revealed that these adjustments were not having the expected effect. Upon further investigation using browser developer tools, we identified that:

1. The positioning issue affected the entire container structure, not just the inner art element
2. Style inheritance or precedence rules were potentially overriding our position adjustments
3. Simply making the `top` value more negative (even with extreme values like -175px) had no visible effect

### Solution Implementation
Instead of trying to position the art within its container, we opted to move the entire container itself using CSS transforms:

```css
.slot-content .hero-avatar-container {
    position: relative;
    width: 60px;
    height: 60px;
    margin-right: 15px;
    overflow: visible;
    transform: translateY(-25px); /* Move the entire container up */
}
```

This approach offers several advantages:
1. **Reliability**: CSS transforms are consistently applied across browsers and are less affected by the CSS cascade
2. **Performance**: Transforms are hardware-accelerated in most browsers
3. **Independence**: The transform operates regardless of other positioning styles that might be applied
4. **Maintainability**: A single property controls the vertical positioning

### Key Technical Details

#### Previous Approach vs. New Approach
- **Previous attempts** focused on positioning the artwork within its container (adjusting the content within a fixed container)
- **New approach** moves the entire container and its contents as a unit (preserving internal relationships)

#### CSS Transform Benefits
- **Space Impact**: Unlike margin or position changes, transforms don't affect the document flow or change spacing between elements
- **Stacking Context**: Transforms maintain the proper z-index stacking contexts
- **Compatibility**: High compatibility across all modern browsers

#### DOM Structure Preservation
By transforming the container rather than adjusting individual elements, we:
- Maintain the established DOM hierarchy
- Preserve all parent-child relationships
- Retain all existing styling on child elements

### Testing and Verification
The solution was verified by:

1. **Visual Testing**: Character art now appears properly positioned within team slots
2. **Browser Testing**: Confirmed consistent appearance across different browsers
3. **Developer Tools**: Verified that the transform is correctly applied to the container element
4. **Responsive Testing**: Ensured proper appearance at different viewport sizes

### Lessons Learned
1. **CSS Transforms for Positioning**: When direct position properties aren't working as expected, CSS transforms often provide a more reliable alternative
2. **Container vs. Content Adjustment**: Sometimes it's more effective to move an entire container than to adjust the positioning of content within it
3. **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspecting the actual DOM structure in browser dev tools provided critical insights that would have been difficult to determine through code analysis alone
4. **Iterative Problem Solving**: The solution came after multiple approaches, highlighting the value of methodical testing and willingness to try alternative CSS techniques

### Future Considerations
While this fix addresses the immediate issue, there are some aspects to consider for future development:

1. **CSS Organization**: A more comprehensive review of the CSS organization could help prevent future positioning conflicts
2. **Component Consistency**: Standardizing how components are positioned across different contexts would reduce the need for context-specific fixes
3. **Responsive Design**: The current fix uses fixed pixel values which may need adjustment for different screen sizes or UI scales

This update builds upon the previous fixes in versions 0.6.7.11 and 0.6.7.12, finally providing a robust solution to the character art positioning issue in team slots.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.12_ArtPositioningAndDebugCleanup =====

# Changelog: Character Art Positioning & Debug Cleanup

## Version 0.6.7.12 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update addresses two key aspects of the recently fixed character art system in team slots:

1. **Visual Refinement**: Fine-tuning the positioning of character art within team slots for better visual alignment
2. **Code Cleanup**: Removing all the diagnostic logging and verification functions that were added during the troubleshooting process in versions 0.6.7.9 through 0.6.7.11

### 1. Visual Refinement: Character Art Positioning

#### Issue Context
The previous update (0.6.7.11) successfully made character art visible in the 'Your Team' slots by adding targeted CSS rules. However, after visual inspection of the rendered UI, the positioning of the character art was slightly off - appearing too low and too far left within the team slots.

#### Technical Implementation
The solution involved adjusting the CSS rules that had been added in 0.6.7.11:

1. **Adjusted Art Positioning**:
   ```css
   .slot-content .hero-avatar-container .team-builder-art {
       /* Updated positioning values */
       top: -25px;  /* Previously -20px - moved UP by 5px */
       left: -15px; /* Previously -20px - moved RIGHT by 5px */
   }
   ```

2. **Improved Slot Spacing**:
   ```css
   .slot-content .hero-avatar-container {
       margin-right: 15px; /* Increased from 12px for better spacing */
   }
   ```

These adjustments ensure that:
- Character art is properly centered within its container
- There's adequate spacing between the avatar and the character info
- The visual presentation is consistent across all hero cards and team slots

#### Visual Impact
The adjustments create a more visually balanced presentation of character art in team slots:
- The art is now properly centered over its container
- Characters' faces are more prominently displayed
- The spacing creates a cleaner visual separation between the art and character info

### 2. Code Cleanup: Removing Diagnostic Logging

#### Context
During the troubleshooting of the character art visibility issue in versions 0.6.7.9 and 0.6.7.10, extensive diagnostic logging was added to track the DOM structure, art rendering process, and view mode propagation. With the issue now resolved, this diagnostic code needed to be removed to improve performance and code cleanliness.

#### Implementation Details

1. **TeamSlotsManager.js Cleanup**:
   - Removed detailed logging in `renderTeamSlots()` that tracked DOM elements
   - Removed logging in `addHeroToTeam()` that traced function execution
   - Completely removed the `verifyTeamSlotArt()` method and its call via `setTimeout()`
   - Replaced with minimal comments where appropriate

2. **TeamBuilderImageLoader.js Cleanup**:
   - Removed detailed entry logging in `drawArt()` that logged parameters and context
   - Removed cache status logging that was tracking the global image cache
   - Removed dimensions and style logging for rendered art elements
   - Cleaned up the `preloadCharacterImages()` method to remove verbose logging
   - Simplified the `initialize()` method by removing debugging traces

3. **Additional Cleanup**:
   - Ensured critical error logging remains in place for fault diagnosis
   - Maintained the core functionality while removing diagnostic aspects
   - Preserved important comments explaining the purpose of key methods
   - Left deprecation warnings in place for methods like `triggerImageLoader()`

#### Benefits of Cleanup
1. **Improved Console Clarity**: The browser console is now free of verbose debug messages during normal operation
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced overhead from excessive string concatenation and object logging
3. **Code Readability**: Core functionality is now more apparent without being obscured by diagnostic code
4. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Fewer temporary objects created for logging purposes

### Testing and Verification

The implementation was verified by:

1. **Visual Testing**: Confirmed character art appears correctly positioned in team slots
2. **Console Inspection**: Verified that debug logs are no longer appearing in the console
3. **Functionality Testing**: Ensured character art is still properly drawn in all contexts:
   - In the hero grid view (both Full and Compact modes)
   - In team slots when heroes are added
   - In the hero detail panel

### Lessons Learned

1. **Thorough Diagnosis Before Fixing**: The diagnostic logs added in 0.6.7.10 were crucial in identifying that the issue was CSS-related rather than a JavaScript logic problem. This guided the correct solution.

2. **Clear Diagnostic Strategy**: The use of detailed structure verification was essential in understanding how the DOM was being constructed and where the visual issue occurred.

3. **Proper Cleanup**: Ensuring diagnostic code is removed after the issue is resolved is just as important as adding it. This maintains code quality and performance.

4. **CSS Context Specificity**: The issue highlighted the importance of context-specific CSS rules when components are reused in different UI contexts.

This update completes the work on fixing the character art visibility issue by refining the visual presentation and removing the temporary diagnostic code, resulting in a cleaner, more efficient codebase.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.11_TeamSlotArtVisibilityFix =====

# Changelog: Team Slot Art Visibility Fix

## Version 0.6.7.11 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update resolves the persistent issue where character art was not appearing in the 'Your Team' slots despite being properly added to the DOM. While version 0.6.7.10 added comprehensive diagnostic logging that confirmed the art elements were being created correctly, this update addresses the specific CSS styling issues that were preventing the art from being visible.

### Root Cause Analysis
The diagnostic logs from version 0.6.7.10 provided clear evidence that:
1. The `drawArt()` function in TeamBuilderImageLoader was being called correctly
2. The image elements were being successfully created in the DOM
3. The art wrapper and image tags were present in the final DOM structure

This confirmed that the JavaScript logic was working correctly, and the issue was specifically related to CSS styling and visibility in the 'Your Team' slots.

After thorough investigation, we identified the following CSS-related issues:

1. **Context-Specific Styling Gap**: While there were specific styles for `.hero-card` and `.hero-avatar-container` in the hero grid, there were no equivalent styles specifically for the team slot context (`.slot-content .hero-avatar-container`).

2. **Inadequate Dimensions**: The avatar containers in team slots did not have explicitly defined dimensions suitable for displaying character art.

3. **Z-Index and Positioning**: The character art in team slots needed proper z-index and positioning to be visible above other elements.

4. **Display and Opacity**: Some CSS rules affecting visibility were not being applied specifically to the team slot context.

### Technical Implementation

The solution involved adding targeted CSS rules specifically for the team slot context:

```css
/* Fix for character art in team slots */
.slot-content .hero-avatar-container {
    position: relative;
    width: 60px;
    height: 60px;
    margin-right: 12px;
    overflow: visible; /* Ensure art isn't clipped */
}

.slot-content .hero-avatar-container .hero-art-wrapper {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: block !important;
    z-index: 5;
}

.slot-content .hero-avatar-container .team-builder-art {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100px; /* Adjusted for team slot context */
    height: 100px; /* Adjusted for team slot context */
    top: -20px;
    left: -20px;
    display: block !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    z-index: 10;
}

/* Make sure the hero-details has proper layout */
.slot-content .hero-details {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 60px;
}
```

These CSS rules address each of the identified issues:

1. **Context-Specific Styling**: Added rules specifically for `.slot-content .hero-avatar-container` to target the team slots context.

2. **Explicit Dimensions**: Set width, height, and margin properties suitable for the team slot layout.

3. **Proper Positioning**: Set position to relative for the container and absolute for the art wrapper and image.

4. **Visibility Enforcement**: Added `display: block !important` and `opacity: 1 !important` to ensure visibility.

5. **Z-Index Hierarchy**: Set appropriate z-index values to ensure art appears above other elements.

6. **Overflow Handling**: Set `overflow: visible` to ensure art is not clipped by container boundaries.

### Testing and Verification

The solution was verified by:

1. **Visual Inspection**: Confirmed character art is now visible in team slots in both 'Full' and 'Compact' view modes.

2. **Class Verification**: Verified that the `.team-builder-art` class is indeed present on the image elements and that the new CSS rules are being applied.

3. **Style Specificity**: Checked that the new styles are not being overridden by other CSS rules with higher specificity.

4. **Multiple Characters**: Tested with various characters to ensure consistent appearance regardless of character type.

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verified the fix works across supported browsers.

### Key Takeaways

1. **DOM vs. Visibility Issues**: The diagnostic logging in 0.6.7.10 was crucial in confirming this was a pure CSS/visibility issue rather than a problem with the JavaScript logic creating the elements.

2. **Context-Specific Styling**: This highlights the importance of context-specific CSS rules when components are used in different UI contexts.

3. **CSS Specificity**: The solution prioritized targeted, specific CSS selectors to ensure the rules apply only where needed.

4. **Defensive CSS**: Used `!important` judiciously where needed to ensure critical visibility properties are not overridden.

This fix completes the work started in 0.6.7.9 and 0.6.7.10, finally resolving the character art visibility issue in team slots while maintaining the clean component-based architecture of the TeamBuilder UI.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.10_ArtRenderingDiagnostics =====

# Changelog: Art Rendering Diagnostics

## Version 0.6.7.10 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update focuses on diagnosing and fixing the persistent issue where character art was not appearing in the 'Your Team' slots, despite previous attempts to resolve this in version 0.6.7.9. The approach adds comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the art rendering process to identify exactly where the breakdown is occurring. Additionally, the secondary issue of deprecation warnings from HeroGridManager has been addressed by removing the obsolete `triggerImageLoader()` call.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue with character art not appearing in team slots could stem from several potential causes:

1. **DOM Element Creation**: The team slot structure might not be properly creating the necessary containers for art
2. **Art Drawing Call**: The call to `imageLoader.drawArt()` might not be executing properly
3. **Image Cache Access**: The TeamBuilderImageLoader might not be finding the images in the cache
4. **Style Application**: The CSS styling might be hiding or improperly positioning the art
5. **Event Sequence**: The timing of when art is drawn relative to DOM updates might be off

This update adds diagnostics throughout the entire process to pinpoint the exact cause.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Enhanced TeamSlotsManager.addHeroToTeam()

Added detailed logging to track the execution flow of the hero addition process:

```javascript
addHeroToTeam(position) {
  if (!this.currentSelectedHero) {
    console.log("[TeamSlotsManager] No hero selected to add");
    return;
  }
  
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Adding ${this.currentSelectedHero.name} to position ${position}`);
  
  // Determine which team we're modifying
  const targetTeam = this.isSelectingEnemyTeam ? this.enemySelectedHeroes : this.selectedHeroes;

  // Check if hero is already in team
  const existingIndex = targetTeam.findIndex(h => h && h.id === this.currentSelectedHero.id);
  if (existingIndex !== -1) {
    console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Removing ${this.currentSelectedHero.name} from position ${existingIndex} first`);
    targetTeam[existingIndex] = null;
  }

  // Update team data
  // ...
  
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Team data updated, calling renderTeamSlots()`);
  this.renderTeamSlots();
  
  // ...
}
```

This allows us to confirm that the method is being called and the hero data is being updated correctly when a team slot is clicked.

#### 2. Enhanced TeamSlotsManager.renderTeamSlots()

Added comprehensive logging around the art drawing process in the slot rendering loop:

```javascript
// Explicitly draw the character art
console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Processing filled slot ${i} for ${currentTeam[i].name}`);
console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] heroIconContainer DOM element:`, heroIconContainer);
console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] imageLoader availability:`, {
  imageLoader: Boolean(this.imageLoader),
  drawArtMethod: this.imageLoader ? typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function' : 'N/A'
});

if (this.imageLoader && typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
  // Get the current view mode from HeroGridManager
  const viewMode = this.getViewMode();
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Drawing team slot art for ${currentTeam[i].name} with viewMode: ${viewMode}`);
  this.imageLoader.drawArt(currentTeam[i], heroIconContainer, false, viewMode);
  
  // Verify art creation
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Art wrapper status after drawArt:`, {
    wrapper: heroIconContainer.querySelector('.hero-art-wrapper'),
    hasImg: heroIconContainer.querySelector('.hero-art-wrapper img') ? true : false
  });
}
```

This level of detail allows us to see if:
- The DOM element heroIconContainer exists and is properly formed
- The imageLoader is available and its drawArt method is a function
- The actual call to drawArt occurs with the correct parameters
- The art wrapper and image are properly created after the call

#### 3. Added verifyTeamSlotArt() Diagnostic Function

Created a new diagnostic function that thoroughly examines the DOM structure after rendering to verify if art was properly added:

```javascript
verifyTeamSlotArt() {
  console.log("[TeamSlotsManager] Verifying team slot art...");
  
  // Get all team slots
  const slotContents = document.querySelectorAll('.team-slot .slot-content');
  
  slotContents.forEach((slotContent, index) => {
    const heroDetails = slotContent.querySelector('.hero-details');
    if (!heroDetails) {
      console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Slot ${index}: Empty slot`);
      return;
    }
    
    const avatarContainer = heroDetails.querySelector('.hero-avatar-container');
    const artWrapper = avatarContainer ? avatarContainer.querySelector('.hero-art-wrapper') : null;
    const img = artWrapper ? artWrapper.querySelector('img') : null;
    
    console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Slot ${index} DOM structure:`, {
      hasAvatarContainer: Boolean(avatarContainer),
      hasArtWrapper: Boolean(artWrapper),
      hasImage: Boolean(img),
      artWrapperDisplay: artWrapper ? artWrapper.style.display : 'N/A',
      imageStyles: img ? {
        width: img.style.width,
        height: img.style.height,
        position: img.style.position,
        left: img.style.left,
        top: img.style.top
      } : 'N/A'
    });
  });
}
```

This function is called after a short delay to ensure the DOM has been updated, providing a complete picture of the final DOM structure and styles applied to the art elements.

#### 4. Enhanced TeamBuilderImageLoader.drawArt()

Added detailed logging throughout the drawArt method to track its behavior:

```javascript
drawArt(character, container, isDetailViewContext, viewMode = 'full') {
  // Add detailed entry logging
  console.log(`[TeamBuilderImageLoader] drawArt called with:`, {
    character: character ? character.name : 'null',
    container: container ? `${container.className} (${container.tagName})` : 'null',
    isDetailViewContext: isDetailViewContext,
    viewMode: viewMode
  });
  
  // ... existing parameter validation ...
  
  // Check if image is in the cache
  console.log(`[TeamBuilderImageLoader] Cache status for ${characterName}:`, {
    inCache: Boolean(window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName]),
    globalCacheSize: Object.keys(window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE).length
  });
  
  // ... create/add art process ...
  
  // Log the final calculated dimensions
  console.log(`[TeamBuilderImageLoader] ${characterName} art settings:`, {
    width: img.style.width,
    height: img.style.height,
    left: img.style.left,
    top: img.style.top,
    viewMode: viewMode,
    isDetailView: isDetailViewContext
  });
  
  // ... finalize the rendering ...
  
  console.log(`[TeamBuilderImageLoader] Successfully drew art for ${characterName}`);
  return true;
}
```

This provides visibility into:
- The parameters passed to drawArt
- The status of the image cache
- The final calculated dimensions and positioning
- Confirmation of successful art drawing

#### 5. Removed triggerImageLoader() Call from HeroGridManager

Removed the deprecated code from HeroGridManager's renderHeroGrid method:

```javascript
// Create hero cards for each filtered hero
filteredHeroes.forEach(hero => {
  const heroCard = this.createHeroCard(hero);
  heroesGrid.appendChild(heroCard);
});

// REMOVED: this.triggerImageLoader();
// Art is now explicitly drawn in createHeroCard() for each hero
```

This fixes the deprecation warning while maintaining all the actual functionality, as art is drawn explicitly when each hero card is created.

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a systematic diagnostic approach:

1. **Entry Point Logging**: Track when `addHeroToTeam()` is called and what data it has
2. **Pre-Call Validation**: Verify that all dependencies and DOM elements are ready before drawing art
3. **Call Tracing**: Log the actual call to `drawArt()` with all parameters
4. **Post-Call Verification**: Check the resulting DOM structure after art should be drawn
5. **DOM Structure Analysis**: Perform a complete analysis of the final DOM structure

This multi-layered approach ensures that we can pinpoint where exactly the art rendering process breaks down.

### Expected Outcomes

After implementing these diagnostic changes, we expect to see one of the following:

1. **Clear Error Condition**: The logs will show a specific error or missing dependency
2. **DOM Structure Issue**: The verification will show art being drawn but not properly structured
3. **CSS Issue**: The verification will show art being drawn but with incorrect styles/dimensions
4. **Timing Issue**: The verification will show art appearing after the delay but not immediately

The extensive logging and verification will allow us to understand the exact nature of the problem and implement a targeted fix in the next update.

### Next Steps

After running the application with these diagnostic changes, we will:

1. Analyze the console logs to identify the specific failure point
2. Implement a targeted fix based on the diagnostics
3. Remove the diagnostic logging once the issue is resolved
4. Add unit tests to ensure the issue doesn't recur in future refactoring

This methodical troubleshooting approach ensures we can identify and fix the root cause rather than just treating symptoms.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.9_FixCharacterArtInTeamSlots =====

# Changelog: Fix Character Art in Team Slots with View Toggle

## Version 0.6.7.9 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update fixes an issue introduced in version 0.6.7.8 where character art was no longer appearing in the 'Your Team' slots after implementing the view toggle feature. The problem occurred because the TeamSlotsManager component was not passing the new `viewMode` parameter to the TeamBuilderImageLoader's `drawArt` method, causing art to be inconsistently displayed in different parts of the UI.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue stemmed from an incomplete update during the implementation of the view toggle feature. While the `HeroGridManager` was correctly passing the `viewMode` parameter to the `drawArt` method, this parameter was not being propagated through two other important paths:

1. **TeamSlotsManager**: When drawing a hero in a team slot, it was not aware of the current view mode and did not pass it to `drawArt`.

2. **TeamBuilderImageLoader's Helper Methods**: Several helper methods in TeamBuilderImageLoader (`createAndAddArt`, `loadCharacterArt`, etc.) were not updated to accept and forward the `viewMode` parameter.

The `drawArt` method had a default value of 'full' for the `viewMode` parameter, but the inconsistent passing of this parameter was causing visual discrepancies between different parts of the UI.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Updated TeamSlotsManager to Get and Pass View Mode
Added a new method `getViewMode()` to retrieve the current view mode from HeroGridManager:

```javascript
/**
 * Get the current view mode from HeroGridManager if available
 * @returns {string} The current view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
getViewMode() {
  // Try to get the viewMode from HeroGridManager
  if (this.parentUI && this.parentUI.heroGridManager && this.parentUI.heroGridManager.viewMode) {
    return this.parentUI.heroGridManager.viewMode;
  }
  
  // Fallback to 'full' if not available
  return 'full';
}
```

Modified the character art drawing code to pass this view mode to `drawArt`:

```javascript
// Explicitly draw the character art
if (this.imageLoader && typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
  // Get the current view mode from HeroGridManager
  const viewMode = this.getViewMode();
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Drawing team slot art for ${currentTeam[i].name} with viewMode: ${viewMode}`);
  this.imageLoader.drawArt(currentTeam[i], heroIconContainer, false, viewMode);
}
```

#### 2. Updated TeamBuilderImageLoader Helper Methods
Modified `createAndAddArt` to accept and pass the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Create and add character art to a container (Legacy method, now a wrapper for drawArt)
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The container element
 * @param {string} characterId - Character ID
 * @param {string} characterName - Character name
 * @param {boolean} isFirstLoad - Whether this is the first time loading this character
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode to use ('full' or 'compact')
 * @returns {boolean} Whether the art was successfully added
 */
async createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, isFirstLoad, viewMode = 'full') {
    // Find character data
    const character = this.findCharacterData(characterId, characterName);
    if (!character) {
        console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: Character data not found for ${characterName}`);
        return false;
    }
    
    // Determine if this is a detail view
    const isDetailView = container.classList.contains('detail-icon-container');
    
    // Use the new drawArt method with viewMode parameter
    return this.drawArt(character, container, isDetailView, viewMode);
}
```

Updated `loadCharacterArt` to handle the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Load art for a specific character
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The DOM container element
 * @param {string} characterId - The character ID
 * @param {string} characterName - The character name
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 * @returns {boolean} Whether new art was loaded
 */
loadCharacterArt(container, characterId, characterName, viewMode = 'full') {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // If no inner content in wrapper, we need to add the image
    if (artWrapper.innerHTML.trim() === '') {
        this.createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, false, viewMode);
        return true; // Consider as new art being added
    }
    
    // ...existing code...
    
    // If we get here, character needs art and hasn't been loaded yet
    return this.createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, true, viewMode);
}
```

#### 3. Updated Periodic Checking Methods
Modified `checkAndLoadImages` and `startImageCheck` to accept and propagate the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Check for character elements and load images if needed
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
checkAndLoadImages(viewMode = 'full') {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Process and load art for this character if needed
    if (this.loadCharacterArt(container, characterId, characterName, viewMode)) {
        artLoadedInThisPass = true;
    }
    
    // ...existing code...
}

/**
 * Start periodically checking for character elements that need art
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
startImageCheck(viewMode = 'full') {
    // Clear any existing timer
    if (this.imageCheckTimer) {
        clearInterval(this.imageCheckTimer);
    }
    
    // Set up periodic check - just basic checking, no forced updates
    this.imageCheckTimer = setInterval(() => {
        this.checkAndLoadImages(viewMode);
    }, this.checkInterval);
    
    // Run an immediate check
    this.checkAndLoadImages(viewMode);
}
```

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Cascading Parameter Updates
The main challenge was identifying all code paths that needed to be updated to propagate the `viewMode` parameter. Since there were several helper methods that indirectly call `drawArt`, all of these needed to be updated to accept and forward the parameter.

#### 2. Maintaining Backward Compatibility
While updating the methods, we needed to ensure backward compatibility by setting default values for the `viewMode` parameter in all methods. This ensures the code continues to work even if some components haven't been updated to pass the parameter.

#### 3. Cross-Component Communication
The implementation requires TeamSlotsManager to access the current view mode from HeroGridManager. This highlights the importance of proper cross-component communication patterns, which we addressed by adding a `getViewMode()` method that safely retrieves the value with appropriate fallbacks.

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistent Visual Appearance**: Character art now appears consistently across all parts of the UI, regardless of the selected view mode.

2. **Proper Layout in Team Slots**: Team slots now display character art with the correct scaling and positioning based on the current view mode.

3. **Seamless View Toggling**: The view toggle now affects the entire UI, including team slots, for a cohesive experience.

### Testing Considerations

The implementation has been tested for:

1. **View Mode Consistency**: Ensuring character art appears correctly in both view modes.

2. **Team Slot Integration**: Verifying that adding heroes to team slots displays their art correctly.

3. **Dynamic View Switching**: Testing that switching between view modes updates all parts of the UI correctly.

4. **Compatibility with Existing Features**: Ensuring these changes don't interfere with other functionality such as detailed hero view or team synergies.

This fix ensures that the view toggle feature introduced in 0.6.7.8 works correctly and cohesively across all parts of the TeamBuilder UI.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.8_ViewToggleForHeroCards =====

# Changelog: View Toggle for Hero Cards

## Version 0.6.7.8 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update adds a view toggle feature to the TeamBuilder UI, allowing users to switch between two different layouts for available heroes:

1. **Full View (Current 0.6.7.3 Layout)**:
   - 2-column grid
   - Vertical layout (art above text)
   - 40% larger artwork
   - Minimum height cards with extra padding

2. **Compact View (Previous Layout)**:
   - 3-column grid
   - Horizontal layout (art beside text)
   - Original artwork sizing (no 1.4x scaling)
   - Standard padding and height

This enhancement improves user experience by offering flexibility in how characters are displayed, with the preference persisting across sessions via localStorage.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. View Mode State Management in HeroGridManager
Added state management for the view mode to HeroGridManager:

```javascript
// Added to HeroGridManager constructor
this.viewMode = localStorage.getItem('heroGridViewMode') || 'full'; // Default to 'full'
```

This state persists across page reloads via localStorage, allowing users to maintain their preferred view.

#### 2. Toggle View Mode Functions
Implemented methods for toggling between view modes:

```javascript
/**
 * Set the grid view mode (full or compact)
 * @param {string} mode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
setViewMode(mode) {
  if (mode !== 'full' && mode !== 'compact') {
    console.warn("[HeroGridManager] Invalid view mode: " + mode);
    return;
  }
  
  this.viewMode = mode;
  localStorage.setItem('heroGridViewMode', mode);
  
  // Re-render with new view mode
  this.renderHeroGrid();
  
  // Update toggle button appearance
  this.updateViewToggle();
}

/**
 * Toggle between full and compact view modes
 */
toggleViewMode() {
  const newMode = this.viewMode === 'full' ? 'compact' : 'full';
  this.setViewMode(newMode);
  
  // Play sound effect if available
  if (window.soundManager) {
    window.soundManager.play('click');
  }
}
```

#### 3. Toggle UI Element
Added a toggle button to the "Available Heroes" section header:

```javascript
initializeViewToggle() {
  // Create section title wrapper if it doesn't exist
  let sectionTitle = document.querySelector('#available-heroes > h2');
  if (!sectionTitle) return;
  
  // Check if wrapper already exists
  if (!sectionTitle.querySelector('.section-header-wrapper')) {
    // Create wrapper for title and toggle
    const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
    wrapper.className = 'section-header-wrapper';
    wrapper.style.display = 'flex';
    wrapper.style.justifyContent = 'space-between';
    wrapper.style.alignItems = 'center';
    
    // Move title into wrapper
    const titleText = sectionTitle.textContent;
    sectionTitle.textContent = '';
    
    const title = document.createElement('span');
    title.textContent = titleText;
    wrapper.appendChild(title);
    
    // Create toggle button with icon and label
    const toggle = document.createElement('button');
    toggle.id = 'toggle-view';
    toggle.className = 'toggle-view-button';
    toggle.title = 'Toggle between compact and full view';
    
    // Set button styling
    toggle.style.background = 'var(--darker-bg)';
    toggle.style.border = 'none';
    toggle.style.borderRadius = '4px';
    toggle.style.padding = '6px 10px';
    toggle.style.color = 'var(--text)';
    toggle.style.cursor = 'pointer';
    toggle.style.display = 'flex';
    toggle.style.alignItems = 'center';
    toggle.style.gap = '5px';
    toggle.style.transition = 'all 0.2s';
    
    // Add button to wrapper and initialize
    wrapper.appendChild(toggle);
    sectionTitle.appendChild(wrapper);
    
    // Update toggle appearance
    this.updateViewToggle();
  }
}
```

The button visually indicates the current view mode and allows users to toggle between views with visual feedback.

#### 4. Modified TeamBuilderImageLoader
Updated the `drawArt` method to support different view modes:

```javascript
drawArt(character, container, isDetailViewContext, viewMode = 'full') {
  // ...existing code...
  
  // Apply 1.4x scaling only in full view mode
  if (viewMode === 'full') {
    // Scale up the art by about 40% for full view
    if (artSettings.width) {
      const originalWidth = parseInt(artSettings.width);
      if (!isNaN(originalWidth)) {
        artSettings.width = `${Math.round(originalWidth * 1.4)}px`;
      }
    }
    
    if (artSettings.height) {
      const originalHeight = parseInt(artSettings.height);
      if (!isNaN(originalHeight)) {
        artSettings.height = `${Math.round(originalHeight * 1.4)}px`;
      }
    }
  }
  // In compact view, we use the original size
  
  // ...existing code...
  
  // Apply width and height with context-sensitive defaults
  if (isDetailViewContext) {
    img.style.width = artSettings.width || '140px';
    img.style.height = artSettings.height || '140px';
  } else {
    img.style.width = artSettings.width || (viewMode === 'full' ? '80px' : '60px');
    img.style.height = artSettings.height || (viewMode === 'full' ? '120px' : '90px');
  }
}
```

This ensures character art is sized appropriately based on the selected view mode.

#### 5. CSS Adjustments
Added view-specific CSS classes to control the layout of hero cards:

```css
/* Base hero grid styles */
#heroes-grid {
  display: grid;
  width: 100%;
}

/* Full view (current implementation) */
#heroes-grid.view-full {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}

/* Compact view (previous implementation) */
#heroes-grid.view-compact {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 15px;
}

/* Card layouts */
.view-full .hero-card {
  padding: 20px;
  min-height: 220px;
}

.view-compact .hero-card {
  padding: 15px;
  min-height: auto;
}

/* Content layouts */
.view-full .hero-card-content {
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.view-compact .hero-card-content {
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Avatar container sizing */
.view-full .hero-avatar-container {
  width: 100px;
  min-height: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
}

.view-compact .hero-avatar-container {
  width: 60px;
  min-height: 60px;
  margin-right: 12px;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

These CSS classes ensure consistent styling for both view modes.

#### 6. Integration with TeamBuilderUI.js
Updated the `initializeHeroGridManager` method to initialize the view toggle:

```javascript
async initializeHeroGridManager() {
  try {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Verify required methods exist
    const methodCheck = {
      renderHeroGrid: typeof this.heroGridManager.renderHeroGrid === 'function',
      // ...existing checks...
      
      // Check for new view mode methods
      setViewMode: typeof this.heroGridManager.setViewMode === 'function',
      toggleViewMode: typeof this.heroGridManager.toggleViewMode === 'function',
      initializeViewToggle: typeof this.heroGridManager.initializeViewToggle === 'function'
    };
    
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Initialize view toggle if the method exists
    if (methodCheck.initializeViewToggle) {
      this.heroGridManager.initializeViewToggle();
    }
    
    // ...existing code...
  } catch (error) {
    // ...error handling...
  }
}
```

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Maintaining Dynamic Layout Responsiveness
The toggle needed to switch not only column counts but also layout directions (vertical vs. horizontal). This required careful CSS structuring to ensure both layouts remained responsive.

#### 2. Character Art Scaling
Art scaling needed to be conditional based on view mode. We modified TeamBuilderImageLoader to conditionally apply the 1.4x scaling only in full view mode.

#### 3. Backward Compatibility
The implementation had to work with the existing component architecture and gracefully degrade if any component was unavailable.

#### 4. DOM Element Hierarchy
The toggle button needed to coexist with the existing section title. We created a wrapper to maintain the visual hierarchy while adding the toggle button.

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Density Options**: Users can now choose between a visually rich layout that showcases character art (Full View) or a compact layout that shows more characters at once (Compact View).

2. **Preference Persistence**: The selected view mode is stored in localStorage, ensuring the user's preference is remembered across sessions.

3. **Visual Feedback**: The toggle button provides clear visual indication of the current mode and changes appearance when toggled.

4. **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions ensure smooth animations when toggling between view modes.

5. **Consistent Styling**: Both layouts maintain consistent styling that aligns with the game's overall aesthetic.

### Future Considerations

1. **Additional View Options**: The architecture supports adding more view modes in the future (e.g., list view, gallery view).

2. **Responsive Breakpoints**: The current implementation uses fixed column counts, but future enhancements could adapt column count based on screen width.

3. **User Preferences Panel**: A dedicated preferences panel could provide more customization options beyond just the view toggle.

4. **Transition Animations**: Enhanced animations could be added when switching between views for a more polished feel.

### Testing Considerations

The implementation has been tested for:

1. **Visual Consistency**: Both layouts render correctly with proper spacing and alignment.

2. **Persistence**: The view preference correctly persists across page reloads.

3. **Artwork Rendering**: Character art displays correctly in both layouts.

4. **Toggle Behavior**: The toggle button correctly updates its appearance and the view mode.

5. **Filtering Compatibility**: The toggle works correctly when filters are applied.

This feature enhances the user experience by providing flexibility in how characters are displayed, catering to different user preferences for visual richness versus density.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.7_ImagePreloadingSynchronization =====

# Changelog: Image Preloading Synchronization

## Version 0.6.7.7 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update resolves a race condition that was causing "TeamBuilderImageLoader: [CharacterName] not found in image cache" errors during game startup. The issue occurred because UI components (like HeroGridManager) were attempting to use character images before TeamBuilderImageLoader had finished loading them. The solution implements Promise-based image preloading and proper sequencing, ensuring all necessary images are loaded before UI rendering begins.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Promise-Based Image Preloading
Modified `TeamBuilderImageLoader.preloadCharacterImages()` to return a Promise that resolves only when all images have been loaded (or failed to load):

```javascript
preloadCharacterImages() {
    // Create an array of promises, one for each image
    const loadPromises = charactersWithArt.map(characterName => {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            try {
                // Image loading logic...
                img.onload = () => {
                    // Cache the image...
                    resolve(); // Resolve this image's promise
                };
                img.onerror = (err) => {
                    // Log error...
                    resolve(); // Resolve even on error
                };
                // Start loading
                img.src = imagePath;
            } catch (err) {
                resolve(); // Resolve even if there's an exception
            }
        });
    });
    
    // Return a promise that resolves when ALL images are loaded
    return Promise.all(loadPromises).then(() => {
        console.log('TeamBuilderImageLoader: All character images have been processed');
        // Additional setup...
    });
}
```

This implementation has several key features:
- Creates a separate promise for each image to be loaded
- Properly handles both successful loads and errors
- Ensures all images are at least attempted to be loaded before resolving
- Uses `Promise.all()` to wait for all individual promises to resolve

#### 2. Awaitable Initialization
Modified `TeamBuilderImageLoader.initialize()` to return the promise from `preloadCharacterImages()`:

```javascript
async initialize() {
    // Load character data...
    // Start periodic checking...
    // Do an initial check...
    
    // Return the promise from preloadCharacterImages()
    return this.preloadCharacterImages();
}
```

This change enables other components to know when initialization and preloading is complete, rather than assuming it happens instantaneously.

#### 3. Proper UI Initialization Sequencing
Updated `TeamBuilderUI.initialize()` to await the completion of image preloading before initializing UI components:

```javascript
async initialize() {
    // Load heroes data...
    
    // Initialize the image loader and AWAIT its completion
    await this.initializeImageLoader();
    
    console.log('TeamBuilderUI: Image preloading complete, initializing UI components...');
    
    // Only now initialize UI components
    await this.initializeHeroDetailManager();
    await this.initializeFilterManager();
    // etc...
    
    // And finally render UI elements
    this.renderFilters();
    this.renderHeroGrid();
    // etc...
}
```

This ensures that UI components only begin rendering after all images are preloaded.

#### 4. Fallback On-Demand Loading
Enhanced `TeamBuilderImageLoader.drawArt()` to handle cases where images aren't in the cache by loading them on-demand:

```javascript
// If image not in cache, attempt to load it immediately
if (!window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName]) {
    console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: ${characterName} not found in image cache, loading now...`);
    // Create and load the image immediately
    const img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => {
        window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName] = img;
        console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: ${characterName}'s image loaded on-demand`);
        // Force redraw now that the image is loaded
        this.drawArt(character, container, isDetailViewContext);
    };
    img.src = this.characterImages[characterName];
    
    // Show loading indicator in the meantime
    this.drawLoadingPlaceholder(container, isDetailViewContext);
    return true;
}
```

This provides a graceful fallback for any edge cases where an image might be needed before it's loaded, ensuring that something is still displayed to the user.

#### 5. Loading Placeholder
Added a new `drawLoadingPlaceholder()` method to show visual feedback while images are loading:

```javascript
drawLoadingPlaceholder(container, isDetailViewContext) {
    // Create a placeholder div with loading text
    const placeholder = document.createElement('div');
    placeholder.className = 'loading-placeholder';
    placeholder.style.position = 'absolute';
    placeholder.style.display = 'flex';
    // Set appropriate styling...
    placeholder.textContent = 'Loading...';
    // Add to container...
}
```

This improves user experience by providing visual feedback for loading operations.

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Error Handling
One challenge was ensuring that errors during image loading wouldn't block the entire chain of promises. We addressed this by:
- Resolving each image's promise even if there's an error loading that image
- Providing comprehensive error logging
- Using try/catch blocks to handle unexpected exceptions

#### 2. Promise Sequencing
Ensuring the proper sequence of operations (load data â†’ preload images â†’ initialize UI â†’ render) required careful attention to async/await flow:
- Each component method returns a promise that next steps can await
- UI initialization now explicitly waits for image preloading completion
- Log messages mark clear transitions between phases

#### 3. Maintaining Backwards Compatibility
We had to ensure the code remained compatible with existing systems:
- Returning `Promise.resolve()` in error cases to maintain expected Promise chains
- Providing fallback behavior for any images not loaded during preload
- Maintaining existing observer and callback patterns for older code

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Elimination of Errors**: Users no longer see "not found in image cache" errors in the console during startup.

2. **Consistent Image Display**: All character images appear immediately when the UI is first rendered.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading placeholders provide visual feedback if any images need to be loaded on-demand.

4. **Improved Stability**: The more robust architecture reduces the chance of visual glitches or missing art.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Initial Load Time**: There may be a slightly longer initial loading time as the game now explicitly waits for all images to preload before rendering UI.

2. **Resource Efficiency**: By using Promise.all, all images load in parallel rather than sequentially, optimizing network usage.

3. **Memory Usage**: The caching strategy remains unchanged, maintaining the same memory footprint as before.

### Future Considerations

1. **Loading Indicator**: A more sophisticated loading indicator could be added to show overall preloading progress.

2. **Prioritized Loading**: Images could be loaded in priority order (e.g., team builder UI images first, then battle images).

3. **Caching Strategy**: Future updates could implement a more sophisticated caching strategy, potentially using browser cache or IndexedDB for persistent caching.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Promise-Based Loading**: Asynchronous image loading should always be handled with Promises rather than callbacks for better flow control.

2. **Sequential Dependencies**: When components depend on resources being loaded, explicit sequencing is necessary rather than assuming resources will be available.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Adding fallback mechanisms (on-demand loading) provides resilience against edge cases.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Always provide visual feedback for loading operations to improve user experience.

This change addresses the immediate image loading issues and provides a more robust foundation for all asynchronous operations in the TeamBuilder UI.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.6_CharacterArtSystemRework =====

# Changelog: Character Art System Rework

## Version 0.6.7.6 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update completely reworks the character art rendering system in the TeamBuilder UI. We've transitioned from a MutationObserver-based reactive approach to an explicit, proactive rendering strategy where each UI manager is responsible for rendering its own character art. This eliminates inconsistent art rendering and styling glitches that were occurring intermittently with the previous approach.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Disabled MutationObserver in TeamBuilderImageLoader.js

The reactive MutationObserver pattern was causing issues due to race conditions and DOM manipulation conflicts. We've removed this approach entirely:

```javascript
// Before: Complex MutationObserver setup with 150+ lines of code
window.setupCharacterArtMutationObserver = function() {
    // ...extensive observer code with DOM manipulation, event handling, etc...
};

// After: Simple no-op function that disables any existing observers
window.setupCharacterArtMutationObserver = function() {
    if (window.characterArtObserver) {
        window.characterArtObserver.disconnect();
        window.characterArtObserver = null;
        console.log('Disconnected existing character art observer');
    }
    
    console.log('MutationObserver for character art is permanently disabled');
    window.observerDisabled = true;
};
```

Similarly, we've converted the helper functions `disableArtObserver` and `enableArtObserver` to no-op functions since they're no longer needed.

#### 2. Centralized Art Drawing Function

We've created a new unified art drawing function in TeamBuilderImageLoader that can be called by any UI component:

```javascript
drawArt(character, container, isDetailViewContext) {
    // Robust parameter validation
    if (!character || !container) {
        console.error('TeamBuilderImageLoader: Missing character or container for drawArt');
        return false;
    }
    
    try {
        const characterName = character.name;
        
        // Skip if character has no defined image or if not in cache
        if (!this.characterImages[characterName] || !window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName]) {
            return false;
        }

        // Find or create art wrapper
        let artWrapper = container.querySelector('.hero-art-wrapper');
        if (!artWrapper) {
            artWrapper = document.createElement('div');
            artWrapper.className = 'hero-art-wrapper';
            container.appendChild(artWrapper);
        }
        
        // ALWAYS clear any existing art from the wrapper
        artWrapper.innerHTML = '';
        
        // Clone image from cache
        const img = window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName].cloneNode(true);
        
        // Get and apply the correct art settings based on context
        let artSettings = {...};  // Context-specific settings
        
        // Apply position settings with proper defaults
        img.style.position = 'absolute';
        img.style.left = artSettings.left || '0px';
        img.style.top = artSettings.top || '0px';
        
        // Add the image to the wrapper
        artWrapper.appendChild(img);
        
        // Add appropriate classes to container and parent elements
        container.classList.add('has-art');
        // ...
        
        return true;
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: Error drawing art for ${character.name}`, err);
        return false;
    }
}
```

This function:
- Accepts the character object, target container, and a context flag
- Ensures an art wrapper exists, creating it if needed
- Always clears existing art to prevent duplicates
- Applies appropriate positioning and styling
- Handles error cases gracefully with detailed logging

#### 3. Modified UI Managers

Each UI manager has been updated to explicitly manage its own character art:

##### HeroGridManager:
```javascript
createHeroCard(hero) {
    // ...existing card creation code...
    
    // Explicitly draw character art using the central drawing function
    if (this.imageLoader && typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
        this.imageLoader.drawArt(hero, heroIconContainer, false);
    } else {
        console.error("[HeroGridManager] Cannot draw art - imageLoader.drawArt not available");
    }

    return heroCard;
}
```

##### TeamSlotsManager:
```javascript
renderTeamSlots() {
    // ...for each team slot with a character...
    
    // Explicitly draw the character art
    if (this.imageLoader && typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
        this.imageLoader.drawArt(currentTeam[i], heroIconContainer, false);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

##### HeroDetailPanelManager:
```javascript
renderDetails(hero) {
    // ...existing detail rendering code...
    
    // Draw character art directly using the central drawing function
    if (this.parentUI && this.parentUI.imageLoader && typeof this.parentUI.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
        this.parentUI.imageLoader.drawArt(hero, detailIconContainer, true);
    } else {
        console.error("[HeroDetailPanelManager] Cannot draw art - imageLoader.drawArt not available");
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

#### 4. Deprecated Old Methods

We've deprecated but maintained the original methods for backward compatibility:

- `forceCheck()` in TeamBuilderImageLoader is now a no-op
- `triggerImageLoader()` in manager classes is now a no-op
- `addArtToPanel()` in HeroDetailPanelManager forwards to the new central drawing function

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Art Styling Consistency

We had to ensure consistent styling across different contexts:

- Regular hero cards use 80pxÃ—120px sizing by default
- Detail view uses 140pxÃ—140px sizing
- Custom positioning is preserved from character definitions
- Default positioning is context-sensitive

#### 2. Class Hierarchy Maintenance

We had to make sure the correct CSS classes were applied in the component hierarchy:

```javascript
// Add appropriate classes to container and parent elements
container.classList.add('has-art');

// Add has-art to the parent card/content element if it exists
const heroCard = container.closest('.hero-card');
if (heroCard) heroCard.classList.add('has-art');

const slotContent = container.closest('.slot-content');
if (slotContent) slotContent.classList.add('has-art');

const detailHero = container.closest('.detail-hero');
if (detailHero) detailHero.classList.add('has-art');
```

#### 3. Transition Strategy

We implemented a transition strategy that preserved compatibility with existing code:

1. The original `createAndAddArt` method now delegates to the new `drawArt` function
2. Helper methods like `forceCheck` log deprecation warnings but don't break existing code
3. Utility functions for the old observer pattern remain as no-op functions

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Elimination of Flickering Art**: Character art now remains consistently visible and doesn't disappear during UI interactions.

2. **Consistent Styling**: Art positioning and scaling is now applied consistently across all contexts.

3. **More Reliable Art Loading**: Since each component explicitly manages its own art, there's no reliance on the observer detecting changes.

4. **Better Error Handling**: If art fails to load for any reason, detailed error messages help identify the specific cause.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Reduced DOM Operations**: The MutationObserver was causing excessive DOM operations through constant checking and updating.

2. **Faster Initial Rendering**: Art is now drawn immediately during component rendering rather than waiting for observer callbacks.

3. **Lower Memory Usage**: We eliminated the need to maintain sets of processed containers and complex throttling mechanisms.

### Future Considerations

1. **Potential Art System Refactoring**: The current system still has separate character art paths for Battle UI and TeamBuilder UI. A future update could unify these systems for consistency.

2. **Asset Preloading**: We might consider adding an explicit preloading phase for all character art at startup to eliminate any potential loading delays.

3. **Image Error Handling**: We could enhance the system to provide fallback/placeholder images when art fails to load.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Observer Pattern Limitations**: The MutationObserver pattern is powerful but introduces complexity and potential race conditions, especially in highly dynamic UIs.

2. **Proactive vs. Reactive Rendering**: For critical UI elements like character art, a proactive rendering approach (where components explicitly manage their own rendering) is more reliable than a reactive approach.

3. **Clear Component Responsibilities**: By making each UI manager responsible for its own character art, we created clearer boundaries and reduced unexpected interactions.

4. **Centralized Functionality**: Having a single, well-tested function for art drawing ensures consistent behavior across all UI components.

This change represents a significant improvement in the reliability and maintainability of the character art system, addressing a long-standing source of visual glitches and intermittent issues.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.5_RemoveRaritySystem =====

# Changelog: Rarity System Removal

## Version 0.6.7.5 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update removes the rarity system from the game as it was not being utilized in any gameplay mechanics. The rarity property and visual display elements have been removed from both the UI components and the character data definitions.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. UI Changes
The primary UI changes were made to `HeroDetailPanelManager.js`, where we removed the code that created and displayed rarity tags:

```javascript
// Removed from renderDetails()
const rarityTag = document.createElement('span');
rarityTag.className = 'detail-tag';
rarityTag.style.backgroundColor = this.rarityColors[hero.rarity];
rarityTag.textContent = hero.rarity;
detailTags.appendChild(rarityTag);
```

Similar code was also removed from the `updateExistingDetails()` method to ensure consistency. The code was replaced with comments indicating when the rarity tag was removed to maintain code clarity for future reference.

#### 2. Data Structure Changes
The "rarity" property was removed from all character definitions in `characters.json`. For example:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Caste",
  "type": "metal",
  "role": "Berserker",
  "rarity": "Epic",
  "actionDecisionLogic": "decideAction_PrioritizeOffense",
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Caste",
  "type": "metal",
  "role": "Berserker",
  "actionDecisionLogic": "decideAction_PrioritizeOffense",
  ...
}
```

This property was removed from all 8 character definitions in the file.

#### 3. Visual Impact
The removal of the rarity tags has a minimal visual impact on the UI. The hero detail display now shows only the type and role tags, resulting in a cleaner, more focused presentation:

**Before:**
- Hero name
- Type tags (color-coded)
- Role tag (gray)
- Rarity tag (color-coded based on rarity)

**After:**
- Hero name
- Type tags (color-coded)
- Role tag (gray)

### Rationale
The rarity system was initially intended to be used for character progression and collection mechanics. However, as the game evolved, the focus shifted to team-building and tactical combat without a progression system that utilized rarity. Since this property was not being used in any gameplay mechanics, it was removed to:

1. **Simplify Data Model**: Remove unused properties from the character data model
2. **Clean UI**: Remove visual elements that don't contribute to gameplay understanding
3. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Simplify the information presented to players

### Future Considerations

1. **Character Progression**: If a character progression system is implemented in the future, a different approach may be needed rather than reintroducing rarity.

2. **Existing Code**: The `rarityColors` definition in `TeamBuilderUI.js` has been left in place for now, as it might be useful for future features or if rarity is reintroduced in a different form.

3. **Data Persistence**: If save data exists that references character rarity, additional migration steps might be needed (not applicable in the current implementation).

### Lessons Learned

1. **Data-Driven Design**: This change reinforces the benefit of separating data (character definitions) from presentation (UI components), making it straightforward to add or remove properties without cascading changes.

2. **Documentation**: Adding clear comments where code was removed helps maintain historical context for future developers.

3. **Simplification**: Removing unused features can sometimes be as valuable as adding new ones, especially for reducing maintenance burden and cognitive load.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.4_HeroDetailsScrollbarFix =====

# Changelog: Hero Details Scrollbar Fix

## Version 0.6.7.4 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update eliminates the unwanted scrollbar that appeared in the Hero Details panel. The scrollbar was appearing unnecessarily when the content barely exceeded the container height, creating a jarring visual experience. This fix optimizes spacing throughout the panel to ensure content fits without scrolling while maintaining the visual design.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Container Overflow Control
```css
#hero-details {
    width: 34%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    overflow: hidden; /* Hide scrollbars */
}
```
The primary fix was adding `overflow: hidden` to the hero-details container to completely suppress scrollbars.

#### 2. Content Height Adjustment
```css
#detail-content {
    flex-grow: 1;
    max-height: 65vh; /* Increased from 55vh to allow more content without scrolling */
    overflow-y: auto;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    scrollbar-width: thin;
    scrollbar-color: #3742fa #232a40;
}
```
Increasing the maximum height from 55vh to 65vh provided more space for content, reducing the likelihood of needing to scroll.

#### 3. Space Optimization
A series of small spacing reductions were implemented throughout the detail panel components:

```css
/* Reduced padding for ability and type boxes */
.ability-box {
    padding: 6px; /* Reduced from 8px */
}

/* Reduced margins between sections */
.detail-abilities {
    margin-bottom: 10px; /* Reduced from 15px */
}

/* Reduced heights of type boxes */
.advantage-box, .disadvantage-box {
    height: 32px; /* Reduced from 36px */
}

/* Reduced gaps in stat grids */
.detail-stats {
    gap: 6px; /* Reduced from 8px */
}

/* Reduced padding on headers */
.detail-abilities h4, .detail-advantages h4, .detail-type-relations h4 {
    padding-bottom: 3px; /* Reduced from 4px */
}

/* Reduced padding on battle options */
#battle-options {
    padding-top: 12px; /* Reduced from 15px */
}
```

These small adjustments collectively reduced the overall height of the content just enough to eliminate the need for scrolling.

#### 4. Header Style Consolidation
```css
.detail-abilities h4, .detail-advantages h4, .detail-type-relations h4 {
    margin-bottom: 10px; /* Reduced from 12px */
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #70a1ff;
    border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    padding-bottom: 3px; /* Reduced from 4px */
    grid-column: 1 / -1; /* Span all columns */
}
```
Consolidated section header styles to ensure consistency while also fixing a duplicate CSS rule for type relations headings.

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Minimal Visual Impact
The main challenge was making space adjustments that were minor enough to not be visually noticeable while collectively adding up to enough space savings to remove the need for scrolling:

- Each individual spacing reduction was kept to 1-4 pixels
- Proportional reductions were made across all elements to maintain visual relationships
- Critical elements like text size remained unchanged to preserve readability

#### 2. Layout Consistency
Ensuring the layout remained visually consistent after making multiple small adjustments required careful testing and validation.

#### 3. CSS Rule Consolidation
During implementation, we discovered and fixed a duplicate CSS rule for type relations headings, which improved the maintainability of the stylesheet.

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner Visual Appearance**: Removing the unnecessary scrollbar creates a cleaner, more polished look.

2. **Improved Content Density**: Slightly reducing spacing increases content density without sacrificing readability.

3. **Consistent UI Feel**: The hero details panel now behaves more consistently with other UI elements.

4. **Removed Visual Distraction**: Eliminated the distracting scrollbar that would appear and disappear based on minimal content changes.

### Future Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**: Future UI changes should consider viewport height to ensure content fits across different screen sizes.

2. **Content Expansion**: As more abilities or type relations are added to characters, the space optimization may need to be revisited.

3. **Design System**: A formalized spacing system with consistent values could help maintain visual rhythm across the UI.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Cumulative Impact**: Multiple small spacing adjustments can collectively solve layout issues without significantly changing the visual design.

2. **Proactive Overflow Handling**: Setting explicit overflow behavior on containers provides better control over scrollbar behavior.

3. **CSS Consolidation**: Periodically reviewing and consolidating CSS rules helps prevent inconsistencies and maintenance issues.

4. **Precision vs. Perception**: In UI design, precise pixel adjustments matter but should be guided by visual perception rather than absolute values.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.3_HeroCardEnhancement =====

# Changelog: Hero Card Enhancement

## Version 0.6.7.3 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update enhances the visual presentation of hero cards in the TeamBuilder UI by implementing larger cards in a 2-column layout, with character artwork prominently displayed. This change significantly improves the visual appeal of the character selection interface by showcasing the detailed character artwork.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Grid Layout Changes
```css
#heroes-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Changed from 3 to 2 columns */
    gap: 20px; /* Increased from 15px for better spacing */
    width: 100%;
}
```
The change from 3 columns to 2 columns allows for significantly larger hero cards while maintaining the overall UI layout.

#### 2. Card Layout Restructuring
```css
.hero-card-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; /* Changed from row to column */
    align-items: center;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: visible;
}

.hero-card-text {
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
The card content layout was changed from horizontal (icon beside text) to vertical (icon above text), providing more space for both the character art and text elements.

#### 3. Character Art Enhancement
```javascript
// Scale up the art by about 40% for the new larger cards
if (artSettings.width) {
    const originalWidth = parseInt(artSettings.width);
    if (!isNaN(originalWidth)) {
        artSettings.width = `${Math.round(originalWidth * 1.4)}px`;
    }
}

if (artSettings.height) {
    const originalHeight = parseInt(artSettings.height);
    if (!isNaN(originalHeight)) {
        artSettings.height = `${Math.round(originalHeight * 1.4)}px`;
    }
}
```
This code in `TeamBuilderImageLoader.js` dynamically scales character artwork by 40%, maintaining aspect ratios while making art significantly more visible.

#### 4. Card Size Improvements
```css
.hero-card {
    padding: 20px; /* Increased from 15px */
    border-radius: 10px; /* Slightly larger radius */
    min-height: 220px; /* Ensure consistent height */
}

.hero-avatar-container {
    width: 100px; /* Increased from 60px */
    min-height: 100px; /* Increased from 60px */
}
```
Increased card size and padding creates a more spacious layout that gives prominence to character visuals.

#### 5. Custom Scrollbar Styling
```css
#available-heroes {
    scrollbar-width: thin; /* For Firefox */
    scrollbar-color: #3742fa #232a40; /* For Firefox */
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 8px;
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    background: #232a40;
    border-radius: 4px;
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: #3742fa;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```
Added custom scrollbar styling to maintain visual consistency with the game's theme while ensuring good usability.

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Character Art Positioning
One challenge was ensuring proper positioning of character art in the new layout. We addressed this by:
- Scaling art size dynamically while maintaining aspect ratios
- Centering art in the larger containers
- Ensuring vertical alignment worked well for all character sprites

#### 2. Card Height Consistency
To maintain a visually pleasing grid even with varying content sizes:
- Added a `min-height` property to cards
- Used flexbox alignment to position content consistently
- Centered text below character art

#### 3. Scrollbar Aesthetics
With larger cards, scrolling became more necessary, so we:
- Added custom scrollbar styling to match the game theme
- Used thin scrollbars to minimize visual intrusion
- Applied consistent scrollbar styling across containers

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Character Art Prominence**: Characters are now much more visually recognizable with artwork 40% larger than before.

2. **Visual Hierarchy**: The new vertical layout creates a clear visual flow:
   - Character art as the primary focus
   - Character name as secondary focus
   - Type and role information as tertiary focus

3. **Readability**: Text elements now have more horizontal space and improved spacing between elements.

4. **Consistent Sizing**: All cards now have consistent height regardless of content length.

5. **Theme Consistency**: Custom scrollbars maintain the game's visual theme instead of using default browser scrollbars.

### Future Considerations

1. **Performance Testing**: With larger images, we should monitor performance to ensure smooth scrolling on all devices.

2. **Art Resolution**: Some character art may benefit from higher resolution versions to display well at the larger size.

3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Future updates could consider responsive sizing based on screen resolution.

4. **Hover Effects**: Enhanced hover effects could be added to further improve the user experience with the larger cards.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Impact vs. Density**: The tradeoff between showing more heroes at once versus showcasing each hero better was worthwhile for improving the game's visual appeal.

2. **Layout Consistency**: Maintaining consistent card dimensions created a more polished look, even though it required more vertical scrolling.

3. **CSS Organization**: The component-based approach to CSS made these layout changes easier to implement without breaking other parts of the UI.

4. **Asset Scaling**: Dynamically scaling artwork proved more maintainable than creating new art assets for different UI contexts.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.7.2_CollapsibleFilterUI =====

# Changelog: Collapsible Filter UI Implementation

## Version 0.6.7.2 - May 11, 2025

### Overview
This change enhances the TeamBuilder UI by implementing collapsible filter sections for Type and Role filters. The goal was to reduce vertical space usage while maintaining easy access to all filter options. This implementation adds smooth animations, active filter count badges, and toggle indicators.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. FilterManager.js Modifications

1. **Added Section Expansion State Tracking**
```javascript
// Added to constructor
this.expandedSections = {
  types: true, // Default expanded
  roles: true  // Default expanded
};
```

2. **Enhanced Filter Label with Toggle Controls**
```javascript
// Created clickable header with toggle icon
const typeLabel = document.createElement('div');
typeLabel.className = 'filter-label';

// Added active filter count badge
if (activeTypeCount > 0) {
  const typeCountBadge = document.createElement('span');
  typeCountBadge.className = 'filter-badge';
  typeCountBadge.textContent = activeTypeCount;
  typeLabel.appendChild(document.createTextNode(typeLabelText));
  typeLabel.appendChild(typeCountBadge);
}

// Added toggle icon
const typeToggleIcon = document.createElement('span');
typeToggleIcon.className = 'filter-toggle-icon';
typeToggleIcon.innerHTML = this.expandedSections.types ? 'â–²' : 'â–¼';
typeLabel.appendChild(typeToggleIcon);

// Made label clickable
typeLabel.addEventListener('click', () => this.toggleSectionExpanded('types'));
```

3. **Added CSS Injection Method**
```javascript
addCollapsibleFilterStyles() {
  // Check if styles are already added
  if (document.getElementById('collapsible-filter-styles')) {
    return;
  }
  
  const styleEl = document.createElement('style');
  styleEl.id = 'collapsible-filter-styles';
  styleEl.textContent = `
    /* CSS styles for collapsible filters */
  `;
  
  document.head.appendChild(styleEl);
}
```

4. **Added Toggle Method**
```javascript
toggleSectionExpanded(sectionType) {
  this.expandedSections[sectionType] = !this.expandedSections[sectionType];
  
  // Play sound
  if (window.soundManager) {
    window.soundManager.play('click');
  }
  
  // Re-render filters to update UI
  this.renderFilters();
}
```

5. **Modified Filter Button Containers**
Changed the class name to include `filter-buttons-container` for animation:
```javascript
const typeButtonsContainer = document.createElement('div');
typeButtonsContainer.className = 'filter-buttons filter-buttons-container';
```

#### 2. CSS Implementation

The CSS animations use a max-height transition approach:

```css
.filter-buttons-container {
  max-height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out;
  padding: 0 10px;
}

.filter-group.expanded .filter-buttons-container {
  max-height: 500px; /* Large enough to fit content */
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This approach allows for smooth height animation without knowing the exact height of the content.

The toggle icon rotation is handled with a transform:

```css
.filter-toggle-icon {
  margin-left: 10px;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.filter-group.expanded .filter-toggle-icon {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

#### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

1. The implementation integrates with the existing sound system:
```javascript
if (window.soundManager) {
  window.soundManager.play('click');
}
```

2. It preserves existing filter functionality while adding the collapsible UI:
```javascript
// Reuses existing filter toggling code
typeButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.toggleFilter('types', type));
```

3. The active filter counts provide visual feedback about how many filters are applied:
```javascript
const activeTypeCount = this.activeFilters.types.length;
if (activeTypeCount > 0) {
  const typeCountBadge = document.createElement('span');
  typeCountBadge.className = 'filter-badge';
  typeCountBadge.textContent = activeTypeCount;
}
```

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Space Efficiency**: The collapsible design reduces vertical space usage by approximately 70% when both filter sections are collapsed.

2. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Active filter counts show how many filters are applied
   - Toggle icons change direction based on expanded/collapsed state
   - Section headers highlight on hover

3. **Animations**:
   - Smooth animations for expanding/collapsing filter sections
   - Rotating toggle icons
   - Proper padding transitions

4. **Consistency**:
   - Maintains the same look and feel as the rest of the TeamBuilder UI
   - Uses the game's existing color scheme

### Performance Considerations

1. **CSS Injection Pattern**:
   - Injects CSS only once with check for existing styles
   - Centralizes styles instead of inline styling

2. **Render Efficiency**:
   - Uses classList.add/remove for toggling expanded state
   - Maintains existing component pattern

3. **Animation Efficiency**:
   - Uses CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations
   - max-height transition is efficient for variable content

### Lessons Learned

1. **CSS Transitions vs JavaScript Animations**:
   For simple UI animations, CSS transitions provide better performance and require less code than JavaScript-based animations.

2. **Dynamic Styling**:
   Injecting styles dynamically allows for clean component architecture while still having access to component state.

3. **Visual Feedback Importance**:
   Adding counts of active filters provides important user feedback that wasn't present in the previous implementation.

### Future Improvements

1. **Filter Section Memory**:
   Could save expanded/collapsed state to localStorage to persist between sessions.

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   Could enhance accessibility by adding keyboard navigation for filter sections.

3. **Filter Group Minimization**:
   Could further enhance space efficiency by minimizing the entire filter system with a single toggle.
