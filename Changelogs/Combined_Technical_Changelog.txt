===== CHANGELOG_0.6.4.4_BattleAssetLoader_StatusEffectIcons_Remove =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.4 - BattleAssetLoader Status Effect Icons (Remove Phase)

## Overview

This update completes Stage 3 of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan by removing the original status effect icon loading methods from BattleScene.js. This follows the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern outlined in the refactoring plan, with this update representing the final "Remove" step after successful verification of the functionality implemented in 0.6.4.3.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed Original Methods from BattleScene.js

Two methods were completely removed from BattleScene.js:

- **preloadStatusEffectIcons()**: Previously handled loading status effect icons
- **initStatusIconMapping()**: Previously initialized the status icon mapping

This removal represents approximately 80 lines of code eliminated from BattleScene.js, further reducing its complexity and improving separation of concerns.

### 2. Updated BattleScene.preload() Method

Modified the preload method to fully rely on BattleAssetLoader for status effect icons:

```javascript
// Initialize BattleAssetLoader for all assets using a single component
if (window.BattleAssetLoader) {
    this.assetLoader = new window.BattleAssetLoader(this);
    
    // Load all assets through BattleAssetLoader
    this.assetLoader.loadUIAssets();
    this.assetLoader.loadCharacterAssets();
    this.statusIconMapping = this.assetLoader.loadStatusEffectIcons();
    
    // Verify status icon mapping was returned successfully
    if (!this.statusIconMapping || Object.keys(this.statusIconMapping).length === 0) {
        console.error("[BattleScene] Failed to get status icon mapping from BattleAssetLoader");
        this.statusIconMapping = {}; // Use empty object as fallback
        this.showAssetLoadingError = true;
    }
}
```

Key changes:
- No longer calls the original methods as fallbacks
- Improved error handling with clear console messages
- Added empty object fallback for statusIconMapping if loading fails
- Sets showAssetLoadingError flag to trigger visual feedback to the user

### 3. Enhanced Fallback Mechanism

Implemented a more robust fallback mechanism for when BattleAssetLoader is unavailable:

```javascript
// Minimal status effect placeholder
this.load.image('status_placeholder', 'assets/images/icons/status/status-icons/AI_Icons/32px/Placeholder_AI.png');

// Create minimal status mapping
this.statusIconMapping = {
    'default': 'AI_Icons/32px/Placeholder_AI.png'
};
```

This ensures that even in failure cases:
- A basic placeholder icon is loaded
- A minimal mapping is created to prevent undefined references
- The UI can still function with basic status effect visualization

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code by removing the original methods.

2. **Cleaner BattleScene.js**: Further reduced the size and complexity of BattleScene.js.

3. **Single Responsibility**: BattleAssetLoader now has sole responsibility for asset loading.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error reporting and fallbacks for failure cases.

5. **Simplified Code Paths**: Streamlined the preload logic with fewer branching paths.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:

1. Status effect icons continue to load correctly through BattleAssetLoader
2. Tooltips still display with proper icons and information
3. The simplified fallback mechanism works if BattleAssetLoader is unavailable
4. No errors appear in the console related to missing methods

## Future Work

This completes Phase 4, Stage 3 of the BattleScene refactoring plan. The next steps would be:

- Stage 4 (Final Phase): Implement a unified loadAssets() method in BattleAssetLoader that handles all asset types

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Refactoring Value**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allowed for safe, incremental refactoring with minimal risk.

2. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensuring proper fallback mechanisms maintains system stability even when components fail.

3. **Error Feedback**: Providing visual feedback to users when assets fail to load improves the user experience.

4. **Refactoring Benefits**: The BattleScene.js file is now significantly cleaner and more focused on its core responsibilities.

This update completes the status effect icon loading refactoring, continuing the progressive improvement of the codebase's architecture and maintainability.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.4.3_BattleAssetLoader_StatusEffectIcons =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.3 - BattleAssetLoader Status Effect Icons Integration

## Overview

This update implements Stage 3 (Extract phase) of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan. It adds status effect icon loading functionality to the BattleAssetLoader component while maintaining backward compatibility with the original methods in BattleScene.js. This follows the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern outlined in the refactoring plan, with this update representing the "Extract" step.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Status Effect Icon Loading to BattleAssetLoader

Added two new methods to BattleAssetLoader.js:

- **loadStatusEffectIcons()**: Loads status effect icons with appropriate error handling
  - Gets the mapping from initStatusIconMapping()
  - Loads each icon using the scene's loader
  - Returns the mapping for BattleScene to use
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

- **initStatusIconMapping()**: Initializes the status icon mapping
  - Uses window.StatusIconMapper when available
  - Provides a complete fallback mapping when StatusIconMapper isn't available
  - Returns the mapping instead of setting it on the instance
  - Includes robust error handling

Key improvements over the original implementation:
- Better error handling with clear fallback strategies
- Explicit return values to provide mapping data to the caller
- More detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Consistent code style with the existing methods

### 2. Updated BattleScene.js to Use BattleAssetLoader

Modified the preload method to use the new BattleAssetLoader functionality:

```javascript
// Add status effect icon loading through the asset loader
this.statusIconMapping = this.assetLoader.loadStatusEffectIcons();

// If status icon mapping wasn't returned properly, fall back to original method
if (!this.statusIconMapping || Object.keys(this.statusIconMapping).length === 0) {
    console.warn("[BattleScene] Status icon mapping not returned from asset loader, using original methods");
    this.preloadStatusEffectIcons();
    this.statusIconMapping = this.initStatusIconMapping();
}
```

This change:
- Uses the BattleAssetLoader for status effect icon loading
- Verifies that the mapping was returned successfully
- Falls back to the original methods if needed
- Maintains backward compatibility during this transitional phase

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Status effect icon loading is now handled by the dedicated BattleAssetLoader component.

2. **Better Error Handling**: The implementation includes comprehensive error handling with appropriate fallbacks.

3. **Reduced Coupling**: BattleScene.js no longer contains the details of status effect icon loading.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allows for safe transition without breaking existing functionality.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:

1. Status effect icons load correctly through BattleAssetLoader
2. Tooltips display with proper icons and information
3. The fallback mechanism works if the BattleAssetLoader fails
4. No errors appear in the console related to status effect icons

## Future Work

This change is part of the ongoing BattleScene refactoring plan:

- Version 0.6.4.3 (Current): Extract status effect icon loading into BattleAssetLoader
- Version 0.6.4.4 (Next): Remove original status effect icon loading methods from BattleScene
- Future versions: Complete Stage 4 to provide a unified asset loading interface

## Lessons Learned

1. **Return Values vs. Properties**: Using return values from methods is often clearer than setting properties on the instance, especially when there might be multiple callers.

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Including proper error handling in each refactored component ensures the system degrades gracefully when issues occur.

3. **Testing Fallbacks**: Ensuring fallback mechanisms work properly is as important as testing the primary code path.

4. **Incremental Approach Benefits**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allows for safer refactoring by maintaining backward compatibility at each step.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.4.2_BattleAssetLoader_Stage2 =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.2 - BattleAssetLoader Stage 2 Implementation

## Overview

This update implements Stage 2 of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan, which extracts character asset loading logic from BattleScene.js into the dedicated BattleAssetLoader component. This completes the second major phase of refactoring in our ongoing effort to reduce the complexity of BattleScene.js and improve the separation of concerns within the codebase.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added `loadCharacterAssets()` Method to BattleAssetLoader

Created a new method in BattleAssetLoader.js that encapsulates all character asset loading logic:

```javascript
loadCharacterAssets() {
    console.log("[BattleAssetLoader] Loading character assets...");
    
    if (!this.scene || !this.scene.load) {
        console.error("[BattleAssetLoader] Cannot load character assets - scene or loader not available");
        return;
    }
    
    try {
        // Basic placeholder asset
        this.scene.load.image('character-circle', 'assets/images/icons/character-circle.png');
        
        // Preload all combat-optimized character art
        const characterArt = [
            'Aqualia', 'Drakarion', 'Zephyr', 'Lumina', 
            'Sylvanna', 'Vaelgor', 'Seraphina' 
        ];
        
        // Special case for Caste due to parentheses in filename
        const casteKey = 'character_Caste';
        const castePath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Caste.png';
        this.scene.load.image(casteKey, castePath);
        console.log(`[BattleAssetLoader] Preloading combat-optimized character image ${casteKey} from ${castePath}`);
        
        characterArt.forEach(name => {
            const key = `character_${name}`;
            // Use the combat-optimized versions of character art
            const path = `assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/${name}.png`;
            this.scene.load.image(key, path);
            console.log(`[BattleAssetLoader] Preloading combat-optimized character image ${key} from ${path}`);
        });
        
        console.log('[BattleAssetLoader] Character art preload complete');
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('[BattleAssetLoader] Could not preload character art:', error);
    }
}
```

The method includes:
- Proper validation of scene and loader availability
- Full error handling with try/catch
- Consistent logging with the BattleAssetLoader prefix
- Loading of all character assets that were previously in BattleScene.js

### 2. Updated BattleScene.js to Use BattleAssetLoader for Character Assets

Modified BattleScene.js to use the new method:

```javascript
// In BattleScene.js preload()
if (window.BattleAssetLoader) {
    this.assetLoader = new window.BattleAssetLoader(this);
    this.assetLoader.loadUIAssets();
    this.assetLoader.loadCharacterAssets(); // Added character asset loading through the loader
    
    // Preload status effect icons - call our dedicated method instead
    this.preloadStatusEffectIcons();
}
```

These changes:
- Remove character asset loading code from the main BattleScene.js path
- Delegate to the BattleAssetLoader component when available

### 3. Simplified the Fallback Path

Removed the redundant character asset loading code from the fallback path, replacing it with minimal essential code:

```javascript
// In BattleScene.js preload() - 'else' branch
console.error("[BattleScene] BattleAssetLoader not available - falling back to minimal asset loading");

// MINIMAL FALLBACK LOADING - just enough to show an error and basic functionality
// Critical UI assets for error display
this.load.image('return-button', 'assets/images/icons/return.png');

// Minimal character assets for basic display
this.load.image('character-circle', 'assets/images/icons/character-circle.png');

// Load status effect icons
this.preloadStatusEffectIcons();

// Set a flag to show an error message to the user
this.showAssetLoadingError = true;
```

The fallback path now:
- Only loads the minimal assets required for basic display
- Shows an appropriate error message to the user
- Eliminates ~30 lines of redundant code from BattleScene.js
- Maintains the status effect icon loading until Stage 3 is implemented

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Character asset loading logic is now handled by a dedicated component rather than mixed into BattleScene's preload method.

2. **Better Maintainability**: Changing the character asset loading process (e.g., adding new characters or tweaking paths) can now be done in a single, focused component.

3. **Code Organization**: The BattleAssetLoader provides a central place for all battle-related asset loading, making the code easier to understand and navigate.

4. **Defensive Programming**: The implementation includes comprehensive parameter validation and error handling at all levels.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:
1. All character assets load correctly when using BattleAssetLoader
2. Character sprites display properly during battles
3. Console logs show the proper loading messages from BattleAssetLoader
4. No error messages appear related to missing character assets

## Next Steps

Now that Stage 2 is complete, we're ready to proceed with Stage 3: Extract Status Effect Icon Loading.

Stage 3 will involve:
1. Adding a `loadStatusEffectIcons()` method to BattleAssetLoader
2. Moving the `initStatusIconMapping()` method to BattleAssetLoader
3. Updating BattleScene to use these methods
4. Removing the original status effect loading code from BattleScene.js


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.4.1_BattleAssetLoader_Phase1_Complete =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.1 - BattleAssetLoader Phase 1 Completion

## Overview

This update completes Stage 1 of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring by fully removing the original UI asset loading code from BattleScene.js. This follows the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern outlined in the refactoring plan, with this update representing the final "Remove" step.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Complete Removal of Original UI Asset Loading Code

In our previous implementation (0.6.4.0), we kept the original UI asset loading code as a fallback in the `else` branch when BattleAssetLoader wasn't available. This update fully removes that code:

```javascript
// Before (0.6.4.0)
if (window.BattleAssetLoader) {
    this.assetLoader = new window.BattleAssetLoader(this);
    this.assetLoader.loadUIAssets();
    // ... character assets loading ...
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleScene] BattleAssetLoader not available, using original loading code");
    
    // Original UI asset loading code retained as fallback
    this.load.image('return-button', 'assets/images/icons/return.png');
    this.load.image('next-turn', 'assets/images/icons/next-turn.png');
    // ... other UI asset loading ...
    
    // ... character assets loading ...
}

// After (0.6.4.1)
if (window.BattleAssetLoader) {
    this.assetLoader = new window.BattleAssetLoader(this);
    this.assetLoader.loadUIAssets();
    // ... character assets loading ...
} else {
    console.error("[BattleScene] BattleAssetLoader not available - cannot load UI assets!");
    
    // Fall back to basic loading (no UI elements)
    // ... character assets loading only ...
    
    // Set a flag to show an error message to the user
    this.showAssetLoadingError = true;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Added a more robust error handling mechanism:

1. Changed console message from `warn` to `error` to better indicate severity
2. Added `showAssetLoadingError` flag to track loading failures
3. Updated the create() method to check this flag and display a user-facing error message

```javascript
// In create() method
// Display error message if asset loading failed
if (this.showAssetLoadingError) {
    this.showErrorMessage("Asset loading incomplete. UI elements may be missing.");
}
```

### 3. Complete the Extract-Verify-Remove Pattern

This update completes all parts of the Stage 1 implementation plan:

- âœ… Part 1: Create BattleAssetLoader with UI asset loading functionality (0.6.4.0)
- âœ… Part 2: Update BattleScene.preload() to use BattleAssetLoader (0.6.4.0)
- âœ… Part 3: Test and verify UI asset loading (0.6.4.0)
- âœ… Part 4: Remove original UI asset loading code (0.6.4.1)

## Benefits

1. **Full Separation of Concerns**: UI asset loading is now entirely handled by the BattleAssetLoader component, with no redundant code in BattleScene.

2. **Cleaner Error Paths**: Instead of keeping duplicated asset loading code, we now have a clear path for error handling with appropriate user feedback.

3. **Reduced BattleScene Complexity**: Further reduces code in BattleScene.js, focusing it on scene management rather than asset loading details.

4. **Better User Experience**: Error conditions now properly notify the user with a visual message rather than just a console error.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify that:

1. Normal operation: UI assets load correctly when BattleAssetLoader is working properly
2. Error handling: When BattleAssetLoader is unavailable, an error message is displayed to the user
3. Character assets: Character sprites continue to load correctly regardless of UI asset status
4. Battle functionality: Game remains playable with UI elements potentially missing

## Next Steps

With Stage 1 now complete, we can proceed to Stage 2: Extract Character Asset Loading. This will follow the same Extract-Verify-Remove pattern to gradually refactor the BattleScene.js file.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.4.0_BattleAssetLoader_Phase1 =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.0 - BattleAssetLoader Implementation (Phase 1: UI Assets)

## Overview

This update implements Phase 1 of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan, which extracts UI asset loading logic from BattleScene.js into a dedicated component. This is part of an ongoing effort to reduce the complexity of BattleScene.js and improve the separation of concerns within the codebase.

## Implementation Details

### New Component: BattleAssetLoader

Created a new component in `js/phaser/core/BattleAssetLoader.js` that centralizes asset loading logic:

```javascript
class BattleAssetLoader {
    constructor(scene) { ... }
    
    loadUIAssets() { ... }
    
    destroy() { ... }
}
```

The component provides:
- Proper validation of dependencies (scene and loader)
- Clear error handling and logging
- A clean interface for loading different asset types
- Lifecycle management with destroy() method

### BattleScene.js Changes

Modified BattleScene.js to:
- Initialize BattleAssetLoader in preload()
- Use assetLoader.loadUIAssets() for UI assets
- Maintain a fallback path if BattleAssetLoader isn't available
- Clean up the assetLoader reference in shutdown()

This change:
- Removes approximately 10 lines of asset loading code from BattleScene.preload()
- Maintains backward compatibility through fallback mechanisms
- Follows the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern from the refactoring plan

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Asset loading is now handled by a dedicated component rather than mixed into BattleScene's preload method.

2. **Better Maintainability**: Asset loading can now be extended or modified without touching BattleScene code.

3. **Code Organization**: The BattleAssetLoader provides a central place for all battle-related asset loading, which will be expanded in future phases.

4. **Defensive Programming**: The implementation includes proper validation and error handling at all levels.

## Future Work

This change represents Phase 1 (UI Asset Loading) of the 4-phase BattleAssetLoader implementation plan. Future phases will:

- Phase 2: Extract character asset loading
- Phase 3: Extract status effect icon loading and mapping
- Phase 4: Combine all asset loading into a unified interface

## Testing Verification

The implementation has been verified by:
1. Starting a battle and confirming all UI elements display correctly
2. Checking that UI buttons, health bars, and turn indicators load and function properly
3. Verifying console logs show proper BattleAssetLoader initialization and UI asset loading
4. Ensuring no errors appear related to missing UI assets

### Observed Unrelated Warnings

During testing, two warnings were observed in the console that are unrelated to this BattleAssetLoader implementation:

```
[BattleUIManager] BattleEventManager not available or missing setBattleLog method
[BattleLogManager] Invalid type 'battle-result', defaulting to 'default'
```

These warnings appear to be pre-existing issues with the BattleEventManager and BattleLogManager components. They should be investigated in a future update when time permits, but they do not affect the functionality of the BattleAssetLoader implementation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Initialization Order**: Ensuring components are initialized in the right order is critical for proper dependency management.

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing graceful fallbacks ensures the game can still function even if component initialization fails.

3. **Logging Strategy**: Strategic logging at key points makes it easier to verify component behavior and diagnose issues.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: The phased approach allows for safe extraction of functionality without risking destabilization of the entire system.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.42_AbilityTypeVisualization =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.42 - Ability Type Visualization Enhancement

## Implementation Goal

The goal of this enhancement was to improve the visual representation of abilities in the hero details panel by coloring each ability box based on its elemental type rather than using a uniform dark background for all abilities. This creates visual consistency between a character's type and their abilities, making it easier for players to identify ability types at a glance.

## Technical Implementation

### Ability Type Detection

The implementation uses a two-step process to determine the appropriate type for each ability:

1. **Effect-Level Type Extraction**: First, we look for a specific damage type in the ability's effects array:

```javascript
// If this is an active ability with effects, try to find a damage type
if (ability.effects && Array.isArray(ability.effects)) {
    // Look for the first damage effect with a damageType
    const damageEffect = ability.effects.find(effect => 
        effect.type === 'Damage' && effect.damageType);
    
    if (damageEffect && damageEffect.damageType) {
        abilityType = damageEffect.damageType;
    }
}
```

2. **Fallback to Character Type**: If no specific damage type is found in the ability's effects (such as for healing or utility abilities), we default to the character's type for visual consistency:

```javascript
let abilityType = hero.type; // Default to character's type
```

### Visual Styling

For each ability box, we apply:

1. **Background Color**: A light tint of the appropriate type color (13% opacity) for subtle differentiation:

```javascript
abilityBox.style.backgroundColor = `${this.typeColors[abilityType]}22`;
```

2. **Left Border**: A slightly more opaque accent (40% opacity) of the same color for better visual distinction:

```javascript
abilityBox.style.borderLeft = `3px solid ${this.typeColors[abilityType]}66`;
```

### Implementation Locations

The changes were made in two locations in TeamBuilderUI.js:

1. The primary `renderHeroDetails()` method for initial character selection
2. The `updateExistingHeroDetails()` method, ensuring the styling persists when switching between characters

## Design Considerations

### Color Intensity

We chose a subtle color implementation with low opacity (13% for background, 40% for border) to:
- Maintain readability of the ability text
- Create visual distinction without overwhelming the UI
- Ensure consistency with the existing UI design language

### Fallback Mechanism

The fallback to character type ensures:
- All abilities have appropriate styling, even utility abilities
- Visual consistency within a character's ability set
- No default dark backgrounds that would disrupt the visual flow

### Left Border Accent

The left border was added to:
- Provide stronger visual differentiation between adjacent abilities
- Create a clear hierarchical structure in the ability grid
- Maintain the established grid layout while adding visual interest

## Testing Results

Testing showed:
- Clear visual distinction between different ability types
- Improved readability of the ability grid
- Successful application of type colors to abilities like:
  - Drakarion's "Flame Strike" (fire type)
  - Aqualia's "Tidal Wave" and "Frost Chain" (water type)
  - Sylvanna's "Vine Whip" (nature type)

No visual discrepancies or UI issues were observed during testing across different character selections and team compositions.

## Future Enhancements

This implementation lays the groundwork for potential future enhancements:

1. **Type-Specific Icons**: Small type icons could be added to each ability
2. **Color-Matched Ability Names**: The ability name could be colored to match the type for stronger visual emphasis
3. **Type-Based Animations**: Hover effects specific to each type could be added

These would build upon the current implementation without requiring significant changes to the core approach.

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**: Creates a clearer visual relationship between abilities and their types
2. **Improved Readability**: Makes it easier to scan and identify abilities by type at a glance
3. **Consistent Design Language**: Extends the existing type color system to ability representations
4. **Better User Experience**: Provides additional visual information without requiring more text

## Lessons Learned

1. **Leveraging Existing Color Systems**: Using the already established typeColors object ensured consistency across the application
2. **Defensive Programming**: The implementation includes checks to ensure colors exist before applying them
3. **Visual Subtlety**: Light color tints maintain readability while adding useful information
4. **CSS Opacity Notation**: Hexadecimal opacity notation (e.g., `22` for 13% opacity) is more concise than rgba notation in this context

This enhancement provides a foundation for further visual refinements to the ability system while maintaining a clean, readable interface.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.41_TypeColorSystemExpansion =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.41 - Type Color System Expansion

## Issue Description

The game's elemental type system is designed to support 22 distinct element types as defined in the Version 1.0 Vision document. However, the type colors system in the UI code only included a limited set of colors for the initially implemented types (fire, water, nature, dark, light, and air). As we prepare to add new characters with the remaining elemental types, we needed to expand the color system to include all 22 types with consistent colors across all UI components.

## Implementation Approach

We implemented a comprehensive update to standardize type colors across three key files:

1. **TeamBuilderUI.js** - DOM-based team selection screen
2. **BattleUI.js** - DOM-based battle interface
3. **CharacterSprite.js** - Phaser-based character visualization component

The approach focused on maintaining consistency while ensuring each UI system received the appropriate color format for its rendering needs.

## Technical Details

### 1. TeamBuilderUI.js Changes

Added the full set of type colors to the `typeColors` object in the constructor:

```javascript
this.typeColors = {
    fire: '#ff4757',
    water: '#1e90ff',
    nature: '#2ed573',
    electric: '#F7DF1E',
    ice: '#ADD8E6',
    rock: '#8B4513',
    metal: '#C0C0C0',
    air: '#70a1ff',
    light: '#ffd700',
    dark: '#9900cc',
    psychic: '#DA70D6',
    poison: '#8A2BE2',
    physical: '#CD5C5C',
    arcane: '#7B68EE',
    mechanical: '#778899',
    void: '#2F4F4F',
    crystal: '#AFEEEE',
    storm: '#4682B4',
    ethereal: '#E6E6FA',
    blood: '#8B0000',
    plague: '#556B2F',
    gravity: '#36454F'
};
```

These colors are already used by existing code to:
- Color type filter buttons in the hero selection UI
- Color hero card backgrounds with varying opacity
- Style type text in hero cards and detail views
- Color type tags in the hero details panel

### 2. BattleUI.js Changes

Made two key changes to BattleUI.js:

1. Updated the `typeColors` object in the constructor to match TeamBuilderUI.js:

```javascript
this.typeColors = {
    fire: '#ff4757',
    water: '#1e90ff',
    nature: '#2ed573',
    electric: '#F7DF1E',
    ice: '#ADD8E6',
    rock: '#8B4513',
    metal: '#C0C0C0',
    air: '#70a1ff',
    light: '#ffd700',
    dark: '#9900cc',
    psychic: '#DA70D6',
    poison: '#8A2BE2',
    physical: '#CD5C5C',
    arcane: '#7B68EE',
    mechanical: '#778899',
    void: '#2F4F4F',
    crystal: '#AFEEEE',
    storm: '#4682B4',
    ethereal: '#E6E6FA',
    blood: '#8B0000',
    plague: '#556B2F',
    gravity: '#36454F'
};
```

2. Enhanced the CSS classes for type backgrounds in the `addCustomStyles()` method:

```javascript
/* Type colors for backgrounds */
.bg-fire { background-color: #ff4757; }
.bg-water { background-color: #1e90ff; }
.bg-nature { background-color: #2ed573; }
.bg-electric { background-color: #F7DF1E; }
.bg-ice { background-color: #ADD8E6; }
.bg-rock { background-color: #8B4513; }
.bg-metal { background-color: #C0C0C0; }
.bg-air { background-color: #70a1ff; }
.bg-light { background-color: #ffd700; }
.bg-dark { background-color: #9900cc; }
.bg-psychic { background-color: #DA70D6; }
.bg-poison { background-color: #8A2BE2; }

### 3. CharacterSprite.js Changes

Updated the `getTypeColor()` method to use the exact same colors as the DOM-based UI components, but converted to the Phaser-compatible hexadecimal format:

```javascript
getTypeColor(type) {
    const typeColors = {
        fire: 0xFF4757, water: 0x1E90FF, nature: 0x2ED573,
        electric: 0xF7DF1E, ice: 0xADD8E6, rock: 0x8B4513,
        air: 0x70A1FF, light: 0xFFD700, dark: 0x9900CC,
        metal: 0xC0C0C0, psychic: 0xDA70D6, poison: 0x8A2BE2,
        physical: 0xCD5C5C, arcane: 0x7B68EE, mechanical: 0x778899,
        void: 0x2F4F4F, crystal: 0xAFEEEE, storm: 0x4682B4,
        ethereal: 0xE6E6FA, blood: 0x8B0000, plague: 0x556B2F,
        gravity: 0x36454F, neutral: 0xAAAAAA // Added neutral for placeholder
    };
    // Fallback for undefined or null type
    const safeType = typeof type === 'string' ? type.toLowerCase() : 'neutral';
    return typeColors[safeType] || 0xCCCCCC; // Gray fallback
}
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Consistency Across UI Systems**: The same colors are now used consistently across all UI components, ensuring a cohesive visual experience.

2. **Framework-Specific Format Handling**: 
   - DOM-based UIs (TeamBuilderUI.js, BattleUI.js) use CSS hex format with # prefix
   - Phaser components (CharacterSprite.js) use the 0x prefix format that Phaser requires

3. **Future-Proofing**: All 22 element types now have defined colors, allowing new characters of any type to be added without further UI updates.

4. **Reduced Technical Debt**: By implementing all colors now, we avoid creating a backlog of UI updates for each new character type introduction.

5. **Design Consistency**: The type colors are now standardized across the codebase, ensuring that each type has one definitive color.

## Testing Considerations

When testing this change, verify:

1. **Existing Character Display**: Ensure existing character types (fire, water, nature, dark, light, air) continue to display correctly with their original colors in both TeamBuilder and Battle UI.

2. **New Type Support**: Confirm that adding new characters with any of the expanded types (electric, ice, rock, etc.) will automatically use the correct type color.

3. **Visual Consistency**: Verify that the same color values are used consistently across all UI components for each type.

4. **CSS Class Functionality**: Test that the CSS classes (e.g., `.bg-electric`) correctly apply the expected background colors.

## Future Enhancements

While this change provides the necessary foundation for all 22 element types, potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Type Icon System**: Add visual icons for each type to complement the color system.

2. **Type Background Patterns**: Implement subtle background patterns specific to each element type.

3. **Type-Based Animations**: Create type-specific particle effects and animations for abilities.

4. **Color Theme Configuration**: Move type colors to a central configuration file that can be imported by all components, further improving maintainability.

## Conclusion

This update successfully implements the full type color system across all UI components, providing a solid foundation for introducing characters with the remaining element types. The consistent color scheme enhances the visual cohesion of the game while supporting the planned 22-type system defined in the Version 1.0 Vision document.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.39_PassiveTriggerTrackerReferenceHotfix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.39 - PassiveTriggerTracker Reference Hotfix

## Issue Description

When starting a battle, the console consistently displayed the following warning:
```
BattleInitializer.js:31 [BattleInitializer] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset
```

While this warning did not break functionality due to the graceful handling in the BattleInitializer, it indicated an architectural issue with dependency references that needed to be addressed.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from a timing problem in the initialization process between BattleInitializer and PassiveTriggerTracker:

1. **Reference Capture During Construction**: In the BattleInitializer constructor, it stored a direct reference to `battleManager.passiveTriggerTracker`:
   ```javascript
   constructor(battleManager) {
       this.battleManager = battleManager;
       
       // Store references to dependencies to avoid frequent property access
       this.passiveTriggerTracker = battleManager.passiveTriggerTracker;
   }
   ```

2. **Initialization Order in BattleManager**: BattleManager initialized its components in a specific order, creating BattleInitializer before PassiveTriggerTracker:
   ```javascript
   // 1a. Initialize BattleInitializer (required component)
   if (window.BattleInitializer) {
       this.battleInitializer = new window.BattleInitializer(this);
       console.log('BattleManager: BattleInitializer initialized');
   }
   
   // ...later...
   
   // 7. Initialize passive system components
   if (window.PassiveTriggerTracker) {
       this.passiveTriggerTracker = new window.PassiveTriggerTracker();
       console.log('BattleManager: PassiveTriggerTracker initialized');
   }
   ```

3. **Stale Reference**: When BattleInitializer's `initializeTeamsAndCharacters()` method was called, it tried to use its locally stored reference to `passiveTriggerTracker`, which was still null because it had captured the reference before PassiveTriggerTracker was initialized in BattleManager:
   ```javascript
   if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
       this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
   } else {
       console.warn("[BattleInitializer] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset");
   }
   ```

4. **Graceful Degradation**: While BattleInitializer properly handled the null reference with a warning message, it still indicated an architectural flaw in the initialization process.

## Technical Solution

The solution changed how BattleInitializer accesses the PassiveTriggerTracker, ensuring it always uses the current reference from BattleManager rather than a potentially stale local copy:

```javascript
// Modified code in initializeTeamsAndCharacters()
if (this.battleManager.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    this.battleManager.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleInitializer] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset (accessed via battleManager)");
}
```

This approach ensures BattleInitializer always accesses the most up-to-date reference to PassiveTriggerTracker, regardless of when it was initialized in BattleManager.

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Eliminated Warning**: The warning no longer appears during battle initialization.

2. **Improved Reference Management**: The code now ensures that dependencies are accessed properly even if initialized after the dependent component.

3. **Maintained Graceful Degradation**: The solution preserves the graceful handling of potentially missing dependencies.

4. **No State Update Required**: The local `this.passiveTriggerTracker` reference can remain in the constructor as it's no longer being used in the critical path.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:
1. The warning no longer appears in the console when starting a battle
2. Passive abilities continue to function correctly
3. No new errors are introduced

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dynamic Dependency Resolution**: When components have dependencies that might be initialized later, always access them through their source (e.g., `parentObject.dependency`) rather than storing local references at construction time.

2. **Initialization Order Matters**: Component initialization order is critical when using direct references. Consider more robust patterns like:
   - Lazy loading through getter methods
   - Dependency injection with proper lifecycle management
   - Event-based architecture for loosely coupled components

3. **Graceful Degradation Value**: The original warning-and-continue approach allowed the system to function correctly despite the missing dependency, highlighting the value of defensive programming.

4. **Spot Check Harmless Warnings**: Even warnings that don't break functionality should be addressed, as they often point to architectural issues that could cause more serious problems in the future.

This fix resolves the specific warning while maintaining the existing architecture. Future refactoring could consider implementing more robust dependency management patterns.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.39_BattleEndDetectionFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.39 - Battle End Detection Fix

## Issue Description

When a battle was intended to finish after all enemies were defeated, it would sometimes continue indefinitely. During these "zombie battles," the console would display many error messages like:

```
[ActionGenerator] AUTO-ATTACK for Vaelgor: No valid enemy targets found!
[TargetingSystem] No valid targets available for Vaelgor
[ActionGenerator] No valid target found for Vaelgor
```

This occurred because enemy characters with 0 HP were not consistently marked with `isDefeated = true`, causing a mismatch between the battle end detection logic and the battle flow controller's target finding logic.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from inconsistent character defeat state management across the code:

1. **Missing isDefeated Assignment**: When a character's HP reached 0, the system detected it was "killed" but didn't always set the `isDefeated` flag:

   ```javascript
   // In DamageCalculator.applyDamage()
   const killed = oldHealth > 0 && target.currentHp <= 0;
   // But never did: target.isDefeated = killed;
   ```

2. **HP vs isDefeated Discrepancy**: The battle end detection checked both `isDefeated` and `currentHp <= 0`:

   ```javascript
   const enemyDefeated = this.battleManager.enemyTeam.filter(char => char.isDefeated || char.currentHp <= 0).length;
   ```

   But other parts of the code would only check `isDefeated` when determining valid targets.

3. **Inconsistent Setters**: There were multiple paths in the code for handling character defeat, not all of which consistently set both `currentHp = 0` and `isDefeated = true`.

4. **Debugging Logs Confirmation**: Battle logs confirmed the issue showing enemies at 0 HP but battle continuing:
   
   ```
   [Turn 4] Lumina (enemy) takes 11 damage! (HP: 0/117)
   [Turn 4] Lumina (enemy) is defeated! âš°ï¸
   ```
   
   Yet many turns later: 
   ```
   [Turn 25] Enemy Team:
   [Turn 25]   Lumina: HP: 0/117
   ```

## Technical Solution

We implemented a two-part solution:

### 1. Fix in BattleFlowController.checkBattleEnd()

Added a pre-check to ensure characters with 0 HP are properly marked as defeated:

```javascript
async checkBattleEnd() {
    // Ensure all characters with 0 HP are properly marked as defeated
    this.battleManager.playerTeam.forEach(char => {
        if (char.currentHp <= 0 && !char.isDefeated) {
            console.log(`[BattleFlowController.checkBattleEnd] Fixing player character ${char.name} with 0 HP but not marked as defeated`);
            char.isDefeated = true;
        }
    });
    
    this.battleManager.enemyTeam.forEach(char => {
        if (char.currentHp <= 0 && !char.isDefeated) {
            console.log(`[BattleFlowController.checkBattleEnd] Fixing enemy character ${char.name} with 0 HP but not marked as defeated`);
            char.isDefeated = true;
        }
    });
    
    // Rest of the method...
}
```

### 2. Fix in DamageCalculator.applyDamage()

Ensured the `isDefeated` flag is properly set when a character is killed:

```javascript
// Determine if character was killed by this damage and set isDefeated
const killed = oldHealth > 0 && target.currentHp <= 0;

// If killed, ensure isDefeated flag is set
if (killed) {
    console.log(`[DamageCalculator] Character ${target.name} is defeated, setting isDefeated to true`);
    target.isDefeated = true;
}
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Consistent State Management**: Characters with 0 HP are now always properly marked as defeated, maintaining a consistent state across the system.

2. **Proper Battle End Detection**: Battles now correctly end when all enemies are defeated, preventing endless battles.

3. **Reduced Console Errors**: Eliminated the flood of "No valid targets" error messages that would appear when battles continued past their proper end point.

4. **Preventive Approach**: The solution not only fixes the current issue but also addresses potential similar issues with player characters.

5. **Defensive Programming**: Added diagnostic logging to reveal when the fix is actively working, making future issues easier to identify.

## Testing Verification

Test cases to verify the fix:

1. **Standard Battle**: Ensure battles end properly when all enemy characters reach 0 HP.
2. **Edge Case - 0 HP Characters**: Verify characters with exactly 0 HP are properly marked as defeated.
3. **Mixed Team States**: Test scenarios where some enemies are defeated and others are still alive to ensure battles continue appropriately.
4. **Console Messages**: Check that diagnostic messages appear when the fix is actively correcting defeat status.

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Consistency**: In systems with multiple components referencing the same state (like character defeat), ensure all components set and check that state consistently.

2. **Defensive Guards**: Use defensive programming techniques like redundant state checking to catch potential inconsistencies before they become issues.

3. **Logging Strategy**: Strategic diagnostic logs make it easier to identify where and when state inconsistencies occur.

4. **Comprehensive Fixes**: Address issues at both the direct cause (DamageCalculator) and the detection point (BattleFlowController) for maximum reliability.

5. **Battle Lifecycle Management**: Complex turn-based systems benefit from explicit state validation at key decision points to prevent zombie processes.

This fix ensures battles reliably end when all enemies reach 0 HP, improving the game's stability and user experience.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.38_BattleLogManagerHealingTypeFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.38 - BattleLogManager Healing Type Fix

## Issue Description

The game consistently showed a console warning during healing events:
```
BattleLogManager.js:45 [BattleLogManager] Invalid type 'healing', defaulting to 'default'
```

This warning occurs when `BattleLogManager.logMessage()` receives 'healing' as the `type` parameter, but 'healing' is not included in the `validTypes` array defined in the BattleLogManager constructor. While this doesn't cause functional issues in the game (as the system defaults to 'default' type), it creates unnecessary console noise and indicates a mismatch between message creation and validation.

## Investigation Approach

To diagnose the exact source of the 'healing' message type, we added a `console.trace()` in the BattleLogManager.logMessage method:

```javascript
// Ensure type is valid
if (!this.validTypes.includes(type)) {
    console.warn(`[BattleLogManager] Invalid type '${type}', defaulting to 'default'`);
    if (type === 'healing') { console.trace(`[BattleLogManager] Trace for 'healing' type`); }
    type = 'default';
}
```

This allowed us to capture the complete call stack when the 'healing' type was used, leading us directly to the source of the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the stack trace, we identified that the root cause was in the `BattleManager.applyHealing()` method, where the code was using the `healType` parameter directly as the message type when calling `logMessage()`:

```javascript
// In BattleManager.applyHealing()
const message = source
    ? `${targetInfo} is healed for ${actualHealing} HP from ${sourceInfo}'s ${healType}! (HP: ${target.currentHp}/${target.stats.hp})`
    : `${targetInfo} is healed for ${actualHealing} HP from ${healType}! (HP: ${target.currentHp}/${target.stats.hp})`;
this.logMessage(message, healType); // Here 'healing' was used as the message type
```

Since the `healType` parameter defaults to 'healing' in `HealingProcessor.applyHealing()`, this value was being propagated all the way to the message type without validation against `validTypes`.

## Technical Solution

We implemented a simple solution by adding 'healing' to the valid message types in BattleLogManager:

```javascript
// In BattleLogManager.js constructor
this.validTypes = ['default', 'info', 'success', 'action', 'error', 'player', 'enemy', 'status', 'healing'];
```

This approach was chosen over modifying all calling code because:
1. It maintains the semantic meaning of "healing" messages
2. It allows for future styling of healing messages differently from other types
3. It's a smaller, less invasive change than modifying multiple call sites
4. It's more extensible for future healing-related UI enhancements

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Eliminated Console Warnings**: The warning no longer appears during healing events, reducing noise in the developer console
2. **Maintained Semantic Intent**: The original intention of having a distinct 'healing' message type is preserved
3. **Future Styling Options**: With 'healing' as a valid type, we have the option to style healing messages differently in future UI enhancements
4. **Documentation Improvement**: The tracing technique used has been documented for future debugging of similar issues

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:
1. No more "Invalid type 'healing'" warnings appear in the console when healing occurs
2. Healing messages display correctly in the battle log
3. All existing healing functionality continues to work as expected

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type Validation Points**: When implementing validation systems like message type checking, it's important to ensure all potential types are either included in the validation list or normalized before validation
2. **Console.trace() Value**: Using `console.trace()` is a powerful technique for diagnosing the source of issues in event-driven systems where the call path isn't immediately obvious
3. **Parameter Propagation**: Default parameter values (like `healType = 'healing'`) can propagate through multiple method calls, requiring careful tracking when used for validation
4. **Semantic Message Types**: Using semantically meaningful message types (like 'healing' instead of 'success' or 'default') improves code readability and makes future UI enhancements easier

This fix ensures consistency between message creation and validation, eliminating the console warnings while maintaining the semantic intent of the original code.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.37_PassiveBehaviorsStatusEffectRoutingFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.37 - PassiveBehaviors Status Effect Routing Fix

## Issue Description

When passive abilities applied status effects, BattleBridge.js displayed console warnings: "BattleBridge: Creating minimal fallback for status effect [status_id]". This indicated that while the effects were being applied, their full definitions weren't being properly propagated to the UI, resulting in potential visual issues with tooltips and icons.

The issue primarily manifested with Lumina's team buff passive at the start of battle (passive_TeamBuffOnBattleStart) and affected all 11 passive behaviors that directly called battleManager.addStatusEffect().

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as a disconnect between the v0.6.3.35 fix in StatusEffectManager.js and the way passive abilities applied status effects:

1. **Direct BattleManager Calls**: PassiveBehaviors.js was making direct calls to battleManager.addStatusEffect() instead of routing through StatusEffectManager:
   ```javascript
   // Example from passive_TeamBuffOnBattleStart
   battleManager.addStatusEffect(ally, statusId, actor, effectDuration, 1);
   ```

2. **Architectural Gap**: While the StatusEffectManager had been enhanced in v0.6.3.35 to include full definitions in events (via the dispatchStatusEffectApplied method), this improvement only worked when StatusEffectManager.addStatusEffect() was called directly. The BattleManager.addStatusEffect() method didn't have the same enhancement.

3. **Different Event Paths**: This created two separate event paths:
   - **Proper Path**: Game logic â†’ StatusEffectManager.addStatusEffect â†’ StatusEffectManager.dispatchStatusEffectApplied â†’ BattleBridge (with full definition)
   - **Incomplete Path**: PassiveBehaviors â†’ BattleManager.addStatusEffect â†’ BattleBridge (without definition, requiring fallback)

## Technical Solution

The solution implemented follows the architectural principle that StatusEffectManager should be the consistent point of entry for applying status effects:

1. **Helper Function Creation**: Created a central helper function in PassiveBehaviors.js that routes all status effect applications through StatusEffectManager when available:

```javascript
/**
 * Helper function to apply status effects through StatusEffectManager
 * Falls back to BattleManager.addStatusEffect if StatusEffectManager isn't accessible
 */
function applyStatusEffect(battleManager, character, effectId, source, duration, stacks = 1) {
    // Parameter validation
    if (!battleManager || !character || !effectId) {
        console.warn('[PassiveBehaviors.applyStatusEffect] Missing required parameters', { 
            hasBattleManager: !!battleManager, 
            hasCharacter: !!character, 
            effectId 
        });
        return false;
    }
    
    // Ensure duration is a number
    if (typeof duration !== 'number') {
        console.warn(`[PassiveBehaviors.applyStatusEffect] Invalid duration (${typeof duration}) for ${effectId} - using default 3`);
        duration = 3;
    }
    
    // Try to use StatusEffectManager first
    if (battleManager.statusEffectManager) {
        console.log(`[PassiveBehaviors] Using StatusEffectManager.addStatusEffect for ${effectId}`);
        return battleManager.statusEffectManager.addStatusEffect(character, effectId, source, duration, stacks);
    } else if (typeof battleManager.getStatusEffectManager === 'function') {
        const statusEffectManager = battleManager.getStatusEffectManager();
        if (statusEffectManager) {
            console.log(`[PassiveBehaviors] Using getStatusEffectManager().addStatusEffect for ${effectId}`);
            return statusEffectManager.addStatusEffect(character, effectId, source, duration, stacks);
        }
    }
    
    // Fall back to BattleManager.addStatusEffect
    console.log(`[PassiveBehaviors] StatusEffectManager not accessible, falling back to BattleManager.addStatusEffect for ${effectId}`);
    return battleManager.addStatusEffect(character, effectId, source, duration, stacks);
}
```

2. **Modifying All Direct Calls**: Updated all 11 instances of direct battleManager.addStatusEffect calls in PassiveBehaviors.js to use the new helper function:

```javascript
// Before:
battleManager.addStatusEffect(actor, 'status_crit_up', actor, 2, 1);

// After:
applyStatusEffect(battleManager, actor, 'status_crit_up', actor, 2, 1);
```

3. **Multiple Access Methods**: Implemented fallback mechanisms to handle different ways BattleManager might expose its StatusEffectManager:
   - Direct property access: `battleManager.statusEffectManager`
   - Getter method: `battleManager.getStatusEffectManager()`
   - Fallback to original method if StatusEffectManager isn't accessible

4. **Parameter Validation**: Added comprehensive parameter validation to catch potential issues early and provide helpful error messages.

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Architectural Alignment**: Solution follows the principle that StatusEffectManager should be the single point of entry for status effect management, aligning with the component-based architecture.

2. **Elimination of Warnings**: The "Creating minimal fallback for status effect" warnings no longer appear since all status effects now flow through the proper channel that includes their definitions.

3. **Improved Tooltip Display**: Status effects applied by passive abilities now display proper tooltips with accurate information when hovered over.

4. **Robust Error Handling**: The helper function includes comprehensive parameter validation and fallbacks to prevent errors.

5. **Defensive Programming**: The implementation follows defensive programming patterns with proper validation and graceful degradation.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: The solution maintains backward compatibility through its fallback mechanisms.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:
1. No "Creating minimal fallback" warnings appear in the console during battles
2. Status effect tooltips display properly for effects applied by passive abilities
3. Passive abilities that apply status effects continue to function correctly
4. Existing battle mechanics and interactions remain unchanged

## Lessons Learned

1. **Centralized Control Points**: Components like StatusEffectManager should be the sole gateway for their respective domain operations to ensure consistent behavior.

2. **Facade Pattern Value**: The helper function demonstrates the value of facade patterns in ensuring consistent access to subsystems.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Comprehensive validation and fallbacks protect against architectural changes and ensure robust operation.

4. **Event Payload Enrichment**: Components should enrich event payloads with all necessary data before dispatching to avoid downstream workarounds.

5. **Breaking Change Awareness**: The v0.6.3.35 fix created an implicit requirement that StatusEffectManager be used directly, which this change addresses explicitly.

This fix ensures all status effects, regardless of their source, are properly processed and have complete definitions available throughout the system.


===== CHANGELOG_0.6.3.36_DebuggingCleanup =====

# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.36 - Debugging Cleanup

## Issue Description

The game was displaying numerous verbose debugging messages in the console that were tagged as `[DETAILED DEBUG]`. These messages were not causing any functional issues but created unnecessary console spam and potentially impacted performance during battle animations. The debugging outputs were remnants from an unauthorized debugging session (v0.6.3.24) that helped identify and fix the AoE ability text bug, but they were never removed after the fix was implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis

These debug statements were added in v0.6.3.24 as part of an investigation into the AoE ability text display bug, where abilities like "Tidal Wave" or "Frost Chain" were incorrectly showing "Auto Attack" instead of their proper names. While the issue was successfully diagnosed and fixed in v0.6.3.25 and further improved in v0.6.3.26, the debugging code was inadvertently left in the codebase.

The specific debugging statements in question:

1. In `CharacterSprite.js`:
   - Call stack logging in `showActionText()`
   - Detailed ability information logging in `showAttackAnimation()`

2. In `ActionIndicator.js`:
   - Call stack logging in `showAction()`
   - Debug messages in `showAutoAttack()` and `showAbility()`

These statements were marked for removal in the v0.6.3.24 changelog, which stated: "All unauthorized debugging changes should be removed after the investigation is complete."

## Technical Solution

All identified debugging statements were removed from both files:

1. From `CharacterSprite.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Removed from showActionText()
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] CharacterSprite.showActionText called for ${this.character?.name} with text '${actionText}'`);
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] Call stack:`, new Error().stack);
   
   // Removed from showAttackAnimation()
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation called for ${this.character?.name} targeting ${targetSprite?.character?.name}`);
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] Character ability info:`, {
       lastUsedAbility: this.character?.lastUsedAbility || 'unknown',
       isAoE: this.character?.lastUsedAbility?.isAoE || false,
       targetType: this.character?.lastUsedAbility?.targetType || 'unknown',
       abilityName: this.character?.lastUsedAbility?.name || 'unknown'
   });
   ```

2. From `ActionIndicator.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Removed from showAction()
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] ActionIndicator.showAction called with text '${actionText}' for ${this.parent?.character?.name}`);
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] Call stack:`, new Error().stack);
   
   // Removed from showAutoAttack()
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] ActionIndicator.showAutoAttack called for ${this.parent?.character?.name}`);
   
   // Removed from showAbility()
   console.log(`[DETAILED DEBUG] ActionIndicator.showAbility called with name '${abilityName}' for ${this.parent?.character?.name}`);
   ```

We kept the normal logging statements (e.g., those prefixed with `CS.showActionText` or controlled by the `window.VERBOSE_LOGGING` flag) as these are part of the standard logging infrastructure.

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console Output**: Removed verbose and redundant debugging messages that were cluttering the console.

2. **Potential Performance Improvement**: Eliminated unnecessary string concatenation and Error stack trace generation that could impact performance during battle animations.

3. **Code Clarity**: Removed code that was specifically marked for removal, bringing the codebase in line with its intended state.

4. **Reduced Network Traffic**: For deployments using remote logging or telemetry, this reduces unnecessary data transmission.

## Testing

Testing should focus on verifying that:

1. The game functions normally after the change
2. The previously noisy `[DETAILED DEBUG]` messages no longer appear in the console
3. Battle animations and action indicators continue to work as expected
4. Standard logging (non-debug) still works correctly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complete Post-Debugging Cleanup**: After using temporary debugging, ensure all debugging code is removed once the issue is resolved.

2. **Code Review Importance**: Having a code review process that specifically looks for debugging artifacts can prevent them from persisting.

3. **Consistent Logging Strategy**: A well-defined logging strategy with different levels (debug, info, warn, error) can help manage console output more effectively.

4. **Consider Debug Flags**: For future intensive debugging, consider using feature flags (e.g., `window.DEBUG_ACTION_INDICATORS = false`) that can easily disable all related debugging at once.

This cleanup helps maintain code quality and ensures the console remains useful for detecting actual issues rather than being overwhelmed with debugging information from previously resolved issues.
