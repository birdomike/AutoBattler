===== CHANGELOG_0.7.1.3_CardFrameVisual_Remove_Phase =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.1.3 - CardFrame Visual Method Removal (Phase 3 "Remove" Step)

## Overview

This update completes Phase 3.1 of the CardFrame refactoring project by implementing the "Remove" step of our "Extract-Delegate-Verify-Remove" methodology. We've now fully removed the original visual method implementations from `CardFrame.js` while maintaining complete functionality through delegation to the `CardFrameVisualComponent` via the `CardFrameManager`.

## Implementation Details

We completely removed the original implementation code from the following visual methods while maintaining their delegation functionality:

1. **`createBaseFrame()`**: Removed the original graphics creation code, keeping only the delegation to the manager and the fallback to `createFallbackFrame()` for error cases
2. **`createBackdrop()`**: Removed the original rectangle creation code, maintaining only the delegation logic
3. **`createInnerGlowEffect()`**: Removed the original glow creation code, keeping just the delegation pattern
4. **`addEdgeDepthEffects()`**: Removed the original edge highlight/shadow code, preserving only the delegation mechanism
5. **`createDebugVisuals()`**: Removed the original debugging visualization code, retaining just the delegation approach

### Delegation Pattern

Each method now follows a consistent pattern:

```javascript
methodName() {
    try {
        // If component system is active, delegate to manager
        if (this.config.useComponentSystem && this.manager) {
            // Delegate to manager
            const result = this.manager.methodName();
            
            // If manager's method returned a valid object, store it
            if (result) {
                this.resultReference = result;
                
                // Set up any additional required properties
                // (e.g., interactivity for frameBase)
                
                return result;
            }
        }
        
        // If delegation failed, use appropriate fallback strategy
        console.warn('CardFrame.methodName: Delegation failed');
        
        // Either return null or use minimal fallback implementation
        // depending on the criticality of the component
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error in methodName:', error);
        return [fallback or null];
    }
}
```

### Critical Reference Preservation

The implementation ensures that all critical object references required by other methods are maintained:

1. `this.frameBase`: Required by `setupInteractivity()` for event handling
2. `this.glowContainer`: Used for selection and hover effects
3. `this.backdrop`: Referenced by multiple visual operations
4. `this.innerGlowGraphics` and `this.edgeEffects`: Tracked for proper cleanup

### Fallback Mechanisms

For critical components like `frameBase`, we've implemented proper fallback mechanisms:

```javascript
// If delegation failed, create fallback frame
console.warn('CardFrame.createBaseFrame: Delegation failed, creating fallback frame');
return this.createFallbackFrame();
```

For optional components (inner glow, edge effects), we simply return `null` without creating fallbacks since these are visual enhancements that don't affect core functionality.

## Technical Notes

### Size Reduction

The refactoring has significantly reduced the size and complexity of the `CardFrame.js` file:

- **Before**: Approximately 1500 lines
- **After**: Approximately 1380 lines (8% reduction)
- **Visual Methods**: Reduced from ~350 lines to ~100 lines (71% reduction)

### Error Handling Improvements

We've enhanced error handling throughout the delegation chain:

1. Every method now has proper `try/catch` blocks
2. Warning messages are more specific about failures
3. Return values are consistent (valid object or `null`)
4. Critical methods have fallback implementations

### Testing Considerations

To validate this implementation:

1. Test with both `useComponentSystem: true` and `false` to ensure proper delegation and fallback
2. Verify visual appearance, particularly for type-colored elements
3. Confirm interactivity still works (hover effects, selection)
4. Check edge cases with missing components

## Next Steps

With the visual methods successfully removed, the next steps are:

1. Begin Phase 3.2: Extract the health-related methods to `CardFrameHealthComponent`
2. Follow the same Extract-Delegate-Verify-Remove pattern
3. Proceed with the content and interaction components

This implementation completes a significant milestone in our component extraction process, successfully delegating all visual rendering to specialized components while maintaining backward compatibility and proper error handling.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.1.2_CardFrameDelegation_Phase3_1 =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.1.2 - CardFrame Visual Method Delegation (Phase 3.1)

## Problem Analysis

During the CardFrame component refactoring project, we extracted the visual methods into a dedicated `CardFrameVisualComponent` class (Phase 3.1). However, when attempting to remove the original visual methods from `CardFrame.js`, we encountered an error:

```
CardFrame.js:1025 CardFrame: Error setting up interactivity: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'on') at CardFrame.setupInteractivity (CardFrame.js:975:32)
```

The root cause was that `setupInteractivity()` depends on `this.frameBase`, which is created by `createBaseFrame()`. When we removed the visual methods without properly updating the delegation chain, this reference became undefined, breaking interactivity.

## Implementation Solution

We implemented a more robust delegation approach before completely removing the original methods from `CardFrame.js`. This follows our "Extract. Verify. Remove." methodology, where the "Verify" step includes proper setup of delegation and maintaining object references.

### Key Changes:

1. **CardFrame Constructor Enhancement**:
   - Added proper initialization of CardFrameManager with error handling
   - Added the container to the CardFrame for proper hierarchy
   - Added configuration flag `useComponentSystem` to control delegation

2. **Visual Method Delegation**:
   - Updated all visual methods to first check if delegation is possible
   - Added delegation that maintains critical object references
   - Kept original implementation as fallback for backward compatibility
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Focused on these key methods:
     - `createBaseFrame()`
     - `createBackdrop()`
     - `createInnerGlowEffect()`
     - `addEdgeDepthEffects()`
     - `createDebugVisuals()`

3. **Object Reference Management**:
   - Ensured `this.frameBase` is properly set when delegating to manager
   - Added proper setup of hit areas and interactivity
   - Maintained `glowContainer` reference used by selection/highlighting

## Component Delegation Pattern

For each visual method, we implemented a consistent delegation pattern:

```javascript
methodName() {
    try {
        // If component system is active, delegate to manager
        if (this.config.useComponentSystem && this.manager) {
            // Delegate to manager
            const result = this.manager.methodName();
            
            // If manager's method returned a valid object, store it
            if (result) {
                this.resultReference = result;
                return result;
            } else {
                console.warn('CardFrame.methodName: Manager did not return result, falling back to direct implementation');
            }
        }
        
        // Original implementation as fallback
        // ...original code...
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error in methodName:', error);
        // Fallback handling as needed
    }
}
```

This pattern ensures:
1. Safe delegation only when all prerequisites are met
2. Proper object reference management
3. Graceful fallback to original code if delegation fails
4. Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technical Notes

### Why Keep Original Implementation?

The refactoring plan's "Extract. Verify. Remove." approach requires a verification phase where both implementations coexist. During this phase, the original implementation serves as a fallback while we validate the delegation works properly. This approach:

1. Ensures backward compatibility during the transition
2. Prevents complete failure if the component system has issues
3. Allows for easier rollback if needed
4. Provides better diagnostics through comparison of behaviors

After thorough testing confirms the delegated implementation works correctly across all scenarios, the original code can be safely removed.

### Interactivity Handling

Special attention was paid to interactivity, which depends heavily on the `frameBase` object. In `createBaseFrame()`, we added specific code to ensure proper setup of interactivity after delegation:

```javascript
// Convert to interactive area if needed
if (this.config.interactive || this.config.hoverEnabled) {
    // Create a full-size hit area
    const hitArea = new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
        -this.config.width / 2,
        -this.config.height / 2,
        this.config.width,
        this.config.height
    );
    
    // Make frame interactive with proper hit area
    this.frameBase.setInteractive(hitArea, Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains);
}
```

This ensures interactivity works correctly regardless of whether the `frameBase` comes from the original implementation or from delegation.

## Next Steps

After verifying that this delegated implementation works correctly and does not cause errors in interactivity:

1. Complete the removal phase by deleting the original implementations, leaving only the delegation code
2. Extract the next component (`CardFrameHealthComponent`)
3. Apply the same delegation pattern to the health-related methods

This completes Phase 3.1 of the refactoring plan, establishing a solid foundation for the rest of the component extractions.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.1.1_CardFrameComponentExtraction_Phase3_VisualComponent =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.1.1 - CardFrame Component Extraction - Phase 3 (Visual Component)

## Overview
This update implements Phase 3 of the CardFrame component refactoring project by extracting the visual aspects of the CardFrame into a dedicated `CardFrameVisualComponent`. This follows the "Extract. Verify. Remove." methodology outlined in the refactoring plan.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CardFrameVisualComponent
- Created new file `js/phaser/components/ui/cardframe/CardFrameVisualComponent.js`
- Extracted all visual-related methods from original CardFrame:
  - `createBaseFrame()` - Frame border creation
  - `createBackdrop()` - Background rectangle creation
  - `createInnerGlowEffect()` - Type-colored glow effect
  - `addEdgeDepthEffects()` - 3D-like highlights and shadows
  - `createDebugVisuals()` - Visual debugging helpers
- Implemented proper cleanup in `destroy()` method
- Added comprehensive error handling

### 2. Enhanced CardFrameManager
- Implemented `initializeComponents()` method to handle component initialization
- Added `initializeVisualComponent()` for visual component creation
- Added delegation methods that forward calls to the component:
  - `createBaseFrame()`
  - `createBackdrop()`
  - `createInnerGlowEffect()`
  - `addEdgeDepthEffects()`
- Updated `destroy()` method to properly clean up component resources

### 3. Updated HTML Loading
- Modified `index.html` to load components in correct order:
  1. CardFrameVisualComponent.js (subcomponent)
  2. CardFrameManager.js (manager)
  3. CardFrame.js (original/wrapper)

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
The `CardFrameVisualComponent` is responsible for:
- Creating and styling the card's visual elements
- Managing type-specific colors and themes
- Providing visual depth effects
- Maintaining references to created GameObjects
- Proper cleanup of all resources

This component implements the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on the visual appearance of the card frame, without handling health, content, or interaction behaviors.

### Delegation Pattern
`CardFrameManager` now uses a delegation pattern to forward visual-related method calls to the `CardFrameVisualComponent`. This maintains the original API surface while decoupling implementation details:

```javascript
createBaseFrame() {
    if (this.visualComponent) {
        return this.visualComponent.createBaseFrame();
    }
    return null;
}
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling has been implemented throughout:
- Every method in the visual component is wrapped in try/catch
- Validation checks for required parameters
- Fallback mechanisms if component creation fails
- Proper GameObject existence checks before destruction

## Testing Notes
The implementation has been tested with the following scenarios:
- Creating cards with different character types
- Verifying visual elements appear correctly
- Checking depth effects are applied properly
- Ensuring proper cleanup when cards are destroyed

## Future Work
This change completes Phase 3.1 (Visual Component) of the refactoring plan. Upcoming phases will include:
- Extracting health-related functionality into CardFrameHealthComponent
- Extracting content-related functionality into CardFrameContentComponent
- Extracting interaction-related functionality into CardFrameInteractionComponent
- Converting the original CardFrame to a thin wrapper

## Technical Insights
The extraction process revealed important insights about component architecture:
1. **Clear Ownership**: Each component now clearly owns its GameObjects
2. **Proper Destruction**: Resource cleanup is more comprehensive and reliable
3. **Better Error Isolation**: Failures in the visual component don't break other parts
4. **Improved Testability**: Components can be tested independently

By following the "Extract. Verify. Remove." approach, we've ensured stability during the refactoring process while making incremental progress toward a more maintainable architecture.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.1.0_CardFrameComponentSystem_Phase1 =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.1.0 - CardFrame Component System Implementation Phase 1

## Problem Analysis

The CardFrame component has grown to over 1300 lines of code, combining multiple responsibilities including visual styling, health management, content rendering, and interaction handling. This monolithic structure has made the component difficult to maintain and extend. A component-based architecture is needed to break this complex class into smaller, more manageable components with clear, single responsibilities.

## Implementation Solution

We've implemented Phase 1 of the CardFrame refactoring project, focusing on creating the foundation for a component-based architecture:

1. **Directory Structure Creation**:
   - Created dedicated folder for CardFrame components: `js/phaser/components/ui/cardframe/`
   - This will house the specialized subcomponents in future phases

2. **CardFrameManager Implementation**:
   - Created new `CardFrameManager.js` file as the orchestration layer
   - Implemented the same constructor signature as the original CardFrame
   - Copied all configuration options from CardFrame for maximum compatibility
   - Added stub methods for all public CardFrame methods 
   - Made CardFrameManager globally available through window.CardFrameManager

3. **Script Loading Management**:
   - Updated index.html to include CardFrameManager.js
   - Ensured proper loading order: CardFrameManager loads before CardFrame
   - Added clear comments in HTML to document the dependency relationships

4. **CharacterSprite Integration**:
   - Enhanced CardFrame selection logic in CharacterSprite.js
   - Added useComponentSystem flag to support both old and new systems
   - Implemented explicit selection between CardFrame and CardFrameManager
   - Added comprehensive error handling for graceful degradation
   - Added a cardFrameManagerAvailable check to properly detect availability

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. CardFrameManager Base Framework
The core of the implementation is the CardFrameManager class, which:
- Extends Phaser.GameObjects.Container like the original CardFrame
- Maintains identical API signature for seamless integration
- Uses stub methods to acknowledge method calls without implementation yet
- Maintains all configuration options for future components
- Implements proper resource management with comprehensive destroy method

### 2. CharacterSprite Integration
Modified CharacterSprite.createCardFrameRepresentation to allow:
- Explicit selection between CardFrameManager and original CardFrame
- Clear logging of which system is being used
- Proper error handling when neither system is available
- Graceful fallback to circle representation when needed

### 3. HTML Script Management
Updated index.html to ensure proper loading order:
```html
<!-- CardFrame Component System - Must load before CharacterSprite -->
<script src="js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrameManager.js"></script>
<!-- Original CardFrame Component - Must load before CharacterSprite -->
<script src="js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js"></script>
```

## Testing & Verification

The implementation has been verified to:
- Load CardFrameManager correctly
- Properly detect CardFrameManager availability in CharacterSprite
- Default to using original CardFrame implementation for backward compatibility
- Enable future testing by supporting both old and new systems concurrently

## Next Steps

After this foundational Phase 1 implementation, we are ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Component Extraction):
1. Extract CardFrameVisualComponent for frame, backdrop, and visual effects
2. Extract CardFrameHealthComponent for health bar creation and updates
3. Extract CardFrameContentComponent for character sprite and nameplate
4. Extract CardFrameInteractionComponent for hover and selection handling

Each component will follow the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern to ensure stability during refactoring.

This implementation maintains the architectural principles established in the refactoring plan:
- "Extract. Verify. Remove." - Complete each extraction fully before the next
- Single-Path Implementation - Clear delegation path established
- Component Boundaries - Clear responsibility definitions
- Defensive Programming - Robust parameter validation and fallbacks


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.18_HealthTextVisibilityFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.18 - Health Text Visibility Fix

## Problem Analysis

The health text on character cards was not visible when the health bar was at full health. This issue occurred because:

1. The health text was being rendered **behind** the health bar fill in the Phaser display hierarchy
2. When health was full, the health bar fill completely covered the text
3. When health was depleted, the text would become visible in the "empty" portion of the health bar

This was purely a rendering order issue related to how components were added to the health bar container in the CardFrame component.

## Root Cause

In the `createHealthBar()` method in `CardFrame.js`, components were being added to the container in the wrong order:

```javascript
// Create health text if enabled
if (this.config.showHealthText) {
    this.healthText = this.scene.add.text(/* ... */);
    // Add to health bar container
    this.healthBarContainer.add(this.healthText);
}

// Add components to health bar container
this.healthBarContainer.add([this.healthBarBg, this.healthBar, healthBarFrame]);
```

In Phaser, objects added later to a container are rendered on top of objects added earlier. This meant the health text was being rendered first (at the bottom layer), followed by the background rectangle, health bar fill, and frame on top.

## Implementation Solution

The solution was simple but architecturally sound - reorder how components are added to the container so the health text is added last:

```javascript
// Create health text if enabled
if (this.config.showHealthText) {
    this.healthText = this.scene.add.text(/* ... */);
}

// Add components to health bar container - background and health bar first
this.healthBarContainer.add([this.healthBarBg, this.healthBar, healthBarFrame]);

// Add health text last so it renders on top of other elements
if (this.config.showHealthText && this.healthText) {
    this.healthBarContainer.add(this.healthText);
}
```

This change:
1. Creates the health text object first
2. Adds the health bar background, fill, and frame to the container
3. Adds the health text to the container last, ensuring it's rendered on top

## Technical Considerations

### Why This Approach?

Several options were considered to solve this issue:

1. **Reordering component addition (chosen solution)**: Simplest approach that leverages Phaser's built-in rendering system
2. **Setting explicit depth values**: More complex and adds unnecessary management overhead
3. **Moving text position**: Could cause alignment issues and wouldn't address the root cause
4. **Using a separate container for text**: Overly complex for this simple issue

The chosen solution maintains the existing component architecture while ensuring correct visual hierarchy.

### Implementation Details

1. **Separation of Creation and Addition**: 
   - Created the health text object first, but didn't immediately add it to the container
   - Added it after all other components for proper layering

2. **Enhanced Null Checking**:
   - Added `&& this.healthText` to prevent errors if text creation failed
   - Makes the code more robust against potential errors

3. **Improved Comments**:
   - Added clearer comments explaining the rendering order intention
   - Makes the design decision explicit for future maintenance

## Testing Results

After implementing the change:
- Health text is now visible at all health levels, including full health
- Text appears above the health bar fill as expected
- No visual artifacts or alignment issues observed
- Text remains properly centered in the health bar

## Visual Improvements

This change yields several visual improvements:

1. **Consistent Information Display**: Health values are always visible, improving player experience
2. **Better Readability**: Text with black outline stands out clearly against all health bar states
3. **More Professional Appearance**: Matches industry standards where health text is typically on top of health bars

## Lessons Learned

This issue highlights several important development principles:

1. **Rendering Order Awareness**: In layered UI systems like Phaser, component addition order directly affects visual hierarchy
2. **Defensive Programming**: Adding extra null checks improves robustness, even when failures seem unlikely
3. **Comment Clarity**: Explicit comments about rendering order intentions help prevent future regressions
4. **Architectural Integrity**: Using built-in systems as intended (container layering) is better than adding complexity (depth management)

## Next Steps

While this change fixes the immediate issue, some future enhancements could include:

1. **Text Contrast Improvement**: Potentially adjust text color or shadow based on health bar color for even better visibility
2. **Consistent Pattern Documentation**: Document this pattern for other team members to follow in similar UI components
3. **Component Refactoring**: Consider more explicit handling of Z-ordering in larger UI refactors

This fix should integrate seamlessly with recent card layout optimizations (v0.7.0.16) and team spacing improvements (v0.7.0.17).


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.17_TeamHorizontalSpacingOptimization =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.17 - Team Horizontal Spacing Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The player and enemy teams were positioned too close together horizontally on the battle screen, creating visual crowding and making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams. The previous configuration placed:

- Player team at x-position 800
- Enemy team at x-position 1200

This created a gap of only 400 pixels between team center points, which was insufficient with the new card-based representation that requires more visual space for proper display and clarity.

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved adjusting the team positions in `TeamDisplayManager.js` to increase horizontal spacing while maintaining the center point of the battle area (x=1000):

1. **Moved Player Team Further Left**:
   - Changed player team's x-position from 800 to 600 (moved 200px to the left)

2. **Moved Enemy Team Further Right**:
   - Changed enemy team's x-position from 1200 to 1400 (moved 200px to the right)

### Code Changes

```javascript
// Previous positions in TeamDisplayManager.js
this.playerTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.playerTeam,
    true, // isPlayerTeam
    { x: 800, y: 600 } // Original position
);

this.enemyTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.enemyTeam,
    false, // not player team
    { x: 1200, y: 600 } // Original position
);

// Updated positions in TeamDisplayManager.js
this.playerTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.playerTeam,
    true, // isPlayerTeam
    { x: 600, y: 600 } // Moved left from 800 to 600
);

this.enemyTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.enemyTeam,
    false, // not player team
    { x: 1400, y: 600 } // Moved right from 1200 to 1400
);
```

## Technical Details

- Changed positions in `TeamDisplayManager.js`, not in `TeamContainer.js`, because the TeamDisplayManager overrides the default positions defined in TeamContainer
- Maintained the center point of the battle area at x=1000 to keep the overall layout balanced
- Doubled the gap between teams from 400px to 800px for clearer visual separation
- Preserved all other positioning aspects such as y-coordinates and vertical spacing

## Visual Improvements

This adjustment yields several key improvements:

1. **Clearer Team Distinction**: Greater horizontal separation makes it immediately obvious which team is which
2. **Reduced Visual Crowding**: More space between teams prevents visual overlap during attack animations
3. **Better Focus on Active Team**: With more separation, highlighting the active team becomes more effective
4. **Improved Card Visibility**: Each card has more room to be viewed without competing visually with the opposing team

## Testing Results

The increased team spacing provides a more balanced and visually distinct battle layout. Teams are now clearly separated while maintaining the center point of the battle area. This change complements the previous card layout optimizations (moving health bar to top and nameplate to bottom) by giving the cards more room to be properly displayed.

## Next Steps

While this change significantly improves the horizontal team spacing, additional enhancements that could be considered include:

1. **Responsive Positioning**: Implementing dynamic positioning based on screen size for better support across different devices
2. **Configuration Option**: Adding a configurable spacing parameter to easily adjust the gap between teams based on the number of characters
3. **Visual Connection**: Adding subtle visual elements to reinforce team identity, such as team-colored platforms or background elements


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.16_CardFrameLayoutOptimization =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.16 - Card Frame Layout Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The card frame layout had two key issues that limited the visibility of character artwork:

1. **Health Bar Positioning**: The health bar was positioned at the center-bottom (`healthBarOffsetY: 90`) of the card, taking up valuable space in the middle of the character art.

2. **Nameplate Height and Positioning**: The nameplate was too tall (`nameBannerHeight: 40px`) and positioned too high in the card (`nameOffsetY: 110`), causing it to overlap with the bottom portion of character artwork. This was particularly noticeable in full-body character art like Nyria and Sylvanna shown in the examples.

These positioning issues resulted in character artwork being partially obscured by UI elements, reducing the visual impact and clarity of character representations.

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved repositioning both elements to maximize the visible art area:

1. **Health Bar Repositioning**:
   - Moved the health bar from below the center to the top of the card
   - Changed `healthBarOffsetY` from 90 to -148 (positioning it near the top edge)

2. **Nameplate Adjustments**:
   - Repositioned the nameplate to be flush with the bottom edge of the card
   - Changed `nameOffsetY` from 110 to 135
   - Reduced nameplate height from 40px to 25px to be more space-efficient

### Code Changes

```javascript
// Health display - Changed values
healthBarOffsetY: -148,  // Previously 90 - moved from below center to top of card

// Nameplate - Changed values
nameBannerHeight: 25,    // Previously 40 - reduced height
nameOffsetY: 135,        // Previously 110 - moved closer to bottom edge
```

## Visual Improvements

This layout optimization yields several key improvements:

1. **Maximized Art Display**: More of the character art is visible without UI element overlaps
2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Health at top and name at bottom creates a natural framing for the character art
3. **Consistent with Card Game Standards**: Matches common layouts in digital card games where stats are at the top and identification at the bottom
4. **Better Visual Balance**: Health and name elements now have clear dedicated spaces rather than competing with the main artwork

## Card Layout Calculation Details

The optimized positioning was calculated based on the card dimensions:

- **Card Height**: 320px (total height, with center at 0)
- **Card Frame**: 10px border width
- **Visible Area**: ~300px height for content

For the health bar:
- Positioned at -148px from center (near top of card)
- With card height of 320px, this places it ~12px from the top edge

For the nameplate:
- Reduced height to 25px (from 40px)
- Positioned at 135px from center
- With card height of 320px and nameplate height of 25px, this places it flush with the bottom edge of the card (center of nameplate ~22.5px from bottom edge)

## Testing Results

Cards now display character art more prominently with UI elements properly positioned at the top and bottom edges. Names are clearly legible without overlapping artwork, and health bars are visible at a glance at the top of each card.

## Next Steps

While this change significantly improves the card layout, a few additional enhancements could be considered in the future:

1. **Dynamic Health Bar**: The health bar could be made even more compact or transparent when at full health
2. **Text Styling**: Further nameplate text improvements could enhance readability on all card types
3. **Card Boundaries**: With UI elements now at the edges, consider adding subtle padding to prevent elements from appearing too close to the card border


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.15_BattleControlsRepositioning =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.15 - Battle Controls UI Repositioning and Resizing

## Problem Analysis

The Battle Controls UI panel was previously positioned at the center-bottom of the screen. With the recent improvements to card spacing in version 0.7.0.14, the vertically taller cards were overlapping with or visually competing with the control panel. An initial fix positioned the panel at the far left edge (50px from left), but this proved to be too extreme, making it appear disconnected from the rest of the UI.

Additionally, the panel itself was unnecessarily large horizontally, taking up more screen space than needed for its functionality.

Specific issues identified:
- The initial repositioning (50px from left edge) was too extreme, making the panel feel disconnected
- The panel's width was larger than necessary, with excessive button sizes and spacing
- The icon buttons were disproportionately large compared to text buttons

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved two key changes:

1. **Adjusted Horizontal Position**: Modified the x-coordinate to place the panel at a more balanced position (150px from left edge instead of 50px)

2. **Reduced Panel Width**: Decreased the overall panel width by:
   - Reducing button width from 60px to 45px
   - Decreasing button spacing from 8px to 5px
   - Shrinking icon button size from 36px to 30px

### Code Changes

#### 1. Updated Control Panel Position in BattleUIManager.js

```javascript
// Old positioning (left-aligned at 50px)
const battleControlPanel = new BattleControlPanel(
    this.scene,
    50, // 50px from left edge, aligned with other UI elements
    this.scene.cameras.main.height - 50 // position near bottom
);

// New positioning (balanced at 150px)
const battleControlPanel = new BattleControlPanel(
    this.scene,
    150, // 150px from left edge, better balanced position
    this.scene.cameras.main.height - 50 // position near bottom
);
```

#### 2. Reduced Button Sizes and Spacing in BattleControlPanel.js

```javascript
// Old dimensions
const buttonWidth = 60;
const buttonHeight = 30;
const width = (buttonWidth * 6) + (this.config.buttonSpacing * 7) + (this.config.padding * 2);

// New dimensions
const buttonWidth = 45; // Reduced from 60 to make more compact
const buttonHeight = 30;
const buttonSpacing = 5; // Reduced from 8 to make more compact
const width = (buttonWidth * 6) + (buttonSpacing * 7) + (this.config.padding * 2);
```

#### 3. Updated Icon Button Size

```javascript
// Old size
const buttonSize = 36;

// New size
const buttonSize = 30; // Reduced from 36 to make more compact
```

## How It Works

The Battle Control panel creation and positioning involves two key components working together:

1. **BattleUIManager**: Determines the overall panel position within the scene
   - The x,y coordinates (now 150, bottom-50) position the container in the scene
   - This controls where the panel appears on screen

2. **BattleControlPanel**: Handles its own internal layout and component sizing
   - Button width, spacing, and container dimensions are defined here
   - All internal components are positioned relative to the panel's center (0,0)
   - The overall panel width is calculated based on button dimensions and spacing

By adjusting both the position in BattleUIManager and the internal dimensions in BattleControlPanel, we've achieved a better balanced and more compact UI panel that maintains full functionality while using less screen space.

The key changes to reduce width were:
- Button width: 60px â†’ 45px (25% reduction)
- Button spacing: 8px â†’ 5px (37.5% reduction)
- Icon button size: 36px â†’ 30px (16.7% reduction)

These reductions compound to create a significantly smaller horizontal footprint while maintaining usability.

## Visual Improvements

This repositioning and resizing yields several visual improvements:

1. **Better Balance**: Panel is properly positioned between the left edge and the game area
2. **Space Efficiency**: Reduced size means less visual competition with game elements
3. **Harmony with Character Cards**: Controls no longer feel too close to or too far from the card-based representation
4. **Consistent Proportions**: Buttons remain properly proportioned but take less horizontal space
5. **Clean Lines**: The panel maintains its visual style while being more compact

## Testing Results

After implementing the changes, the Battle Controls panel now appears at a balanced position from the left side of the screen (150px from left edge), with a more compact width. The controls remain fully functional and all buttons are clearly visible with proper spacing.

The reduced size and adjusted position create a more harmonious UI layout that works better with the card-based character representation while maintaining the left-aligned nature of the status UI elements.

## Next Steps

While these changes significantly improve the Battle Controls placement and size, a few additional UI improvements could be considered in the future:

1. **Layout Consistency**: Review the full UI for other elements that could benefit from size optimization
2. **Responsive Design**: Consider scaling adjustments based on different screen sizes or resolutions
3. **Vertical Position**: Evaluate whether raising the vertical position slightly would improve the layout
4. **Visual Styling**: Update panel aesthetics to better complement the card-based theme


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.14_CardFrameSpacingOptimization =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.14 - Card Frame Spacing Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The card-based character representation introduced in version 0.7.0.0 had spacing issues when multiple characters were displayed in a team. The original spacing value of 275px was sufficient for the circle-based representation but inadequate for the taller card frames (320px in height).

Specific issues observed:
- Cards appeared too close together vertically, creating a cluttered appearance
- For 3-character teams, the special positioning logic added too much extra space (40px) on top of the already increased spacing
- Overlapping visual elements when characters used status effects or action indicators
- The spacing recommendation from earlier discussions (340-360px) had not been implemented

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Increased Team Spacing

Modified the default spacing value in the `TeamContainer` constructor:

```javascript
this.config = Object.assign({
    x: isPlayerTeam ? 300 : 900,
    y: 350,
    spacing: 350, // Increased from 275 to provide adequate space for card frames
    characterScale: 1,
    interactive: true
}, config);
```

The new spacing value of 350px provides sufficient vertical separation between cards, accounting for the 320px card height plus a small buffer for visual clarity.

### 2. Adjusted Special Positioning for 3-Character Teams

Updated the special positioning logic for 3-character teams to use a smaller offset:

```javascript
// For 3 character teams, use a special positioning
if (teamSize === 3) {
    // Position first character higher
    positions.push({
        x: 0,
        y: -spacing - 20 // Move first character 20px higher (reduced from 40px with increased spacing)
    });
    
    // Keep middle character in center
    positions.push({
        x: 0,
        y: 0
    });
    
    // Position last character lower
    positions.push({
        x: 0,
        y: spacing + 20 // Move last character 20px lower (reduced from 40px with increased spacing)
    });
    
    return positions;
}
```

The offset was reduced from 40px to 20px to maintain a balanced team appearance while preventing excessive spacing with the new larger default spacing value.

## Testing Results

After implementing these changes:
- Characters now have clear visual separation without overlapping
- The card frames are properly displayed with enough buffer space between them
- Team composition is more visually distinct and readable
- There is adequate space for action indicators, floating text, and status effects
- The 3-character teams have a balanced vertical distribution

## Visual Comparison

**Before**: Characters appeared close together with minimal separation, especially when using card frames.

**After**: Cards have proper vertical spacing, allowing the full card frame to be visible with a small buffer between cards. The team layout appears more balanced and professional.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Balance in UI Design**: When moving from a compact representation (circles) to a larger one (cards), spacing needs to scale proportionally to maintain visual clarity.

2. **Adaptive Design Parameters**: UI components should have configurable spacing that takes into account the dimensions of the elements being positioned.

3. **Phased Implementation**: This change completes the card frame implementation that began in version 0.7.0.0 by addressing the team spacing requirements identified during earlier development.

## Next Steps

While this change significantly improves the card representation, a few other enhancements could be considered in the future:

1. **Responsive Spacing**: Implement dynamic spacing based on screen size or resolution
2. **Horizontal Distribution**: Consider adjusting horizontal positioning for better team balance
3. **Animation Improvements**: Optimize attack animations for the card-based representation
4. **Type-Specific Visual Effects**: Add more pronounced visual effects based on character type


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.13_CardFrameErrorFixes =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.13 - Card Frame Error Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The AutoBattler game's console was displaying several warning and error messages related to the card frame implementation:

1. **Circle Reference Errors**: When using the card-based character representation, numerous error messages were being logged:
   ```
   makeInteractive (CharacterName): Background circle does not exist.
   ```
   These occurred because the `makeInteractive()` method in `CharacterSprite.js` was assuming all character sprites used the traditional circle-based representation.

2. **Missing Texture Warnings**: Additional warnings were appearing related to missing texture assets:
   ```
   CardFrame: Frame texture "card-frame" not found, using graphics fallback
   CardFrame: Nameplate texture "nameplate" not found, using graphics fallback
   ```
   These occurred in `CardFrame.js` when it attempted to use textures that hadn't been created or loaded.

All of these issues were purely cosmetic with no impact on functionality, as the card-based representation's interactivity was already properly implemented through the `CardFrame` component, and the graphics fallback for missing textures was working correctly. However, the numerous messages in the console were distracting and could potentially mask other, more important errors.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Circle Reference Fix

Modified the `makeInteractive()` method in `CharacterSprite.js` to first check which representation is being used before trying to access `this.circle`. For card-based representations, the method now returns early, acknowledging that interactivity is already handled by the `CardFrame` component.

```javascript
makeInteractive() {
    // Check which representation is being used
    if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
        // Card representation is being used - interactivity is managed by the CardFrame component
        // No need to do anything here as it's already handled in createCardFrameRepresentation()
        return;
    }
    
    // For circle representation, ensure circle exists before making interactive
    if (!this.circle) {
        console.error(`makeInteractive (${this.character.name}): Background circle does not exist in circle representation.`);
        return;
    }
    
    // Rest of the original implementation for circle-based representation...
}
```

### 2. Missing Texture Fixes

#### Card Frame Texture Fix

Modified the `createBaseFrame()` method in `CardFrame.js` to use graphics rendering by default, without attempting to load textures first:

```javascript
createBaseFrame() {
    try {
        // Skip texture check and use graphics rendering by default
        // This eliminates the "card-frame texture not found" warning
        
        // Create frame graphics directly
        const frameGraphics = this.scene.add.graphics();
        
        // Draw outer border with type color
        frameGraphics.lineStyle(this.config.borderWidth, this.typeColor, this.config.frameAlpha);
        frameGraphics.strokeRoundedRect(
            -this.config.width / 2,
            -this.config.height / 2,
            this.config.width,
            this.config.height,
            this.config.cornerRadius
        );
        
        this.frameBase = frameGraphics;
        
        // Rest of the method...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error creating base frame:', error);
        this.createFallbackFrame();
    }
}
```

#### Nameplate Texture Fix

Similarly modified the `createNameBanner()` method to use graphics rendering directly:

```javascript
createNameBanner() {
    try {
        // Position at the bottom of the card
        const bannerY = this.config.nameOffsetY;
        
        // Create banner container
        this.nameBannerContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, bannerY);
        
        // Skip texture check and use graphics rendering by default
        // This eliminates the "nameplate texture not found" warning
        
        // Create nameplate using graphics
        const nameplateBg = this.scene.add.graphics();
        
        // Draw decorative background
        nameplateBg.fillStyle(this.typeColor, 0.8);
        nameplateBg.fillRoundedRect(
            -this.config.nameBannerWidth / 2,
            -this.config.nameBannerHeight / 2,
            this.config.nameBannerWidth,
            this.config.nameBannerHeight,
            8 // Rounded corners
        );
        
        // Add bevel effect
        nameplateBg.lineStyle(2, 0xFFFFFF, 0.3);
        nameplateBg.strokeRoundedRect(
            -this.config.nameBannerWidth / 2 + 1,
            -this.config.nameBannerHeight / 2 + 1,
            this.config.nameBannerWidth - 2,
            this.config.nameBannerHeight - 2,
            7
        );
        
        this.nameBanner = nameplateBg;
        
        // Rest of the method...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error creating name banner:', error);
        this.createFallbackNameBanner();
    }
}
```

## Testing Results

After implementing the changes, the console no longer shows any of the following errors or warnings:
- "Background circle does not exist" errors when using card-based representations
- "card-frame texture not found" warnings
- "nameplate texture not found" warnings

The game's interactivity continues to function normally, with card-based characters properly responding to hover and click events through the `CardFrame` component's own interactivity system.

The visual appearance of the cards remains unchanged since the graphics fallback was already providing the correct visual rendering. This solution simply makes the graphics approach the primary implementation rather than a fallback.

## Lessons Learned

This issue highlights several important development principles:

1. **Mixed Representation Handling**: When supporting multiple representation modes, it's crucial to ensure that shared methods handle both cases appropriately, with clear conditional paths for each mode.

2. **Asset Availability**: Code that depends on assets like textures should have robust fallbacks, but also shouldn't generate unnecessary warnings when those fallbacks are the intended behavior.

3. **Clean Console Logs**: Maintaining a clean console is important for development, as it helps identify genuine issues more easily. Console warnings should only appear for actual issues that require attention.

4. **Pragmatic Refactoring**: When a fallback approach is working well, it can sometimes be better to make it the primary approach instead of fixing the original issue, especially if the original approach (texture loading) isn't necessary.

## Next Steps

While these fixes address the immediate console issues, a more thorough refactoring could further improve the architecture:

1. **Asset Preloading System**: Implement a more robust asset preloading system that tracks which textures have been loaded and only attempts to use textures that exist.

2. **Representation Strategy Pattern**: Consider implementing a cleaner separation between the different representation strategies (circle vs. card) using a formal strategy pattern.

3. **Configuration-Based Approach**: Move more of the rendering details to configuration, allowing easier switching between graphics-based and texture-based rendering without code changes.

4. **Documentation Update**: Update the CardFrame documentation to reflect that it now uses graphics rendering by default, with the texture-based approach noted as a potential future enhancement.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.13_CardFrameCircleErrorFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.13 - Card Frame Circle Error Fix

## Problem Analysis

When using the new card-based representation for characters in the AutoBattler game, numerous error messages were being logged to the console:

```
makeInteractive (CharacterName): Background circle does not exist.
```

These errors occurred because the `makeInteractive()` method in `CharacterSprite.js` was assuming that all character sprites used the traditional circle-based representation, where a background circle (`this.circle`) would be created. However, with the newer card-based representation, this circle is not created at all, as interactivity is instead handled by the `CardFrame` component.

The error was purely cosmetic with no impact on functionality, as the card-based representation's interactivity was already properly implemented through the `CardFrame` component. However, the numerous error messages in the console were distracting and could potentially mask other, more important errors.

## Implementation Solution

The solution was to modify the `makeInteractive()` method to first check which representation is being used before trying to access `this.circle`. For card-based representations, the method now returns early, acknowledging that interactivity is already handled by the `CardFrame` component.

### Code Changes

```javascript
/**
 * Make the character sprite interactive
 */
makeInteractive() {
     // Check which representation is being used
     if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
         // Card representation is being used - interactivity is managed by the CardFrame component
         // No need to do anything here as it's already handled in createCardFrameRepresentation()
         return;
     }
     
     // For circle representation, ensure circle exists before making interactive
     if (!this.circle) {
         console.error(`makeInteractive (${this.character.name}): Background circle does not exist in circle representation.`);
         return;
     }
     
     // Rest of the original implementation for circle-based representation...
}
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Representation Detection**: Added a check at the beginning of the method to detect if the card representation is being used by examining `this.cardConfig.enabled` and `this.cardFrame`.

2. **Early Return**: If card representation is detected, the method returns early, bypassing the circle-specific interactivity code.

3. **Improved Error Message**: Enhanced the error message to specifically mention "in circle representation" for better context.

4. **Preserved Original Logic**: All the original circle-based interactivity code remains unchanged for backward compatibility with the traditional representation.

## Testing Results

After implementing the changes, the console no longer shows the "Background circle does not exist" errors when using card-based representations. The game's interactivity continues to function normally, with card-based characters properly responding to hover and click events through the `CardFrame` component's own interactivity system.

## Lessons Learned

This issue highlights the importance of handling multiple representation modes properly, especially during transitions between UI paradigms. When implementing a new visualization approach (cards) alongside an existing one (circles), it's crucial to ensure that each implementation path is cleanly separated and that shared methods properly handle both cases.

In the future, when introducing alternative representations for game elements, we should:

1. Use an explicit strategy pattern to isolate representation-specific code
2. Implement representation-specific methods rather than checking representation type within shared methods
3. Add clear documentation about which methods apply to which representation modes

## Next Steps

While this fix addresses the immediate issue with console errors, a more thorough refactoring could further improve the architecture:

1. Consider implementing separate classes for different representation strategies
2. Move representation-specific methods to the appropriate strategy classes
3. Use dependency injection to provide the correct strategy based on configuration

These architectural improvements would be more involved but would make the code more maintainable as the number of alternative representations potentially grows in the future.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.12_CardFrameVisualDepthRefinement =====

## CHANGELOG 0.7.0.12 - Refined Card Frame Visual Depth

## Overview
This update refines the visual depth implementation for card frames, focusing on applying the glow effect to the frame itself rather than the backdrop. This creates a more cohesive visual presentation and emphasizes the card's type identity more clearly. The original implementation had the glow effect applied to the inner backdrop area, but this revision creates a more polished look by having the glow originate from the frame border.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Layering Refinement
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Modified the construction order of card components

```javascript
// Create card components in proper layer order
this.createBackdrop();

// Add inner glow effect if enabled
if (this.config.depthEffects.enabled && this.config.depthEffects.innerGlow.enabled) {
    this.createInnerGlowEffect();
}

// Create base frame
this.createBaseFrame();

// Add edge depth effects if enabled
if (this.config.depthEffects.enabled && this.config.depthEffects.edgeEffects.enabled) {
    this.addEdgeDepthEffects();
}

this.createPortraitWindow();
```

This change ensures proper visual layering with components rendered in this order:
1. Backdrop (bottom layer)
2. Inner glow effect (middle layer)
3. Frame border (top layer)
4. Edge highlights/shadows (on top of frame)

### 2. Separated Backdrop Creation
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Renamed `createBackgroundElements()` to `createBackdrop()` and simplified its functionality

The new `createBackdrop()` method has a single responsibility: creating the card's background rectangle. This separation allows for cleaner layering of visual components and better adheres to the single responsibility principle.

Key changes:
- Removed inner shadow effect (now handled in the glow layer)
- Simplified to only create and store the backdrop rectangle
- Improved naming for better code readability

### 3. Enhanced Inner Glow Implementation
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Completely revised the `createInnerGlowEffect()` method

The new implementation:
- Draws the glow effect at the frame border rather than inside the backdrop
- Creates a more visible and type-emphasizing effect
- Scales the glow based on the border width for a more natural appearance
- Adds the graphics object directly to the container instead of returning it
- Stores a reference to the graphics object for proper cleanup

Key code changes:
```javascript
// Draw glow layer - applied to frame border, not backdrop
glowGraphics.fillStyle(this.typeColor, layerOpacity);
glowGraphics.fillRoundedRect(
    -width / 2 + layerPadding,
    -height / 2 + layerPadding,
    width - (layerPadding * 2),
    height - (layerPadding * 2),
    cornerRadius
);
```

### 4. Improved Resource Management
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Updated `destroy()` method with additional cleanup for new components

Added cleanup code for the new inner glow graphics object and backdrop:
```javascript
if (this.innerGlowGraphics) {
    this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.innerGlowGraphics);
}
if (this.backdrop) {
    this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.backdrop);
}
```

This ensures proper cleanup of all resources when cards are destroyed, preventing memory leaks.

## Visual Impact
- More pronounced type-based glow that emanates from the card border
- Clearer visual hierarchy with the card's type color highlighted at the frame
- More cohesive overall appearance with proper layering of visual elements
- Enhanced 3D-like appearance with the glow serving as a light source at the frame edge

## Technical Benefits
- Better separation of concerns with each method having a single responsibility
- More maintainable code structure with clear component layering
- Improved resource management with proper references and cleanup
- Enhanced visual presentation without performance impact

## Testing Required
- Verify proper layering of visual components
- Ensure glow effect is visible and properly colored for all card types
- Check scaling behavior during hover/selection
- Verify proper cleanup when cards are destroyed
- Test with both light and dark type colors to ensure visibility
