===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.0_HealthBarSingleSourceOfTruth =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.0 - Health Bar Single Source of Truth Implementation

## Overview
This update fixes an architectural inconsistency in how health bar positioning is determined across the component system. Previously, health bar positioning (specifically offsetY) was defined in multiple places, creating confusion and violating the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) principle. This update ensures that CardFrameHealthComponent is the sole authority for all health bar styling and positioning.

## Problem Analysis

While CardFrameHealthComponent.js was intended to be the Single Source of Truth for health bar styling and positioning, the actual architecture didn't fully support this principle. Specifically:

1. **Multiple Sources**: Health bar position (offsetY) was defined in:
   - CardFrameHealthComponent.js (HEALTH_DEFAULTS) - The intended SSoT
   - CardFrameVisualComponent.js (VISUAL_DEFAULTS and CARD_VARIANTS) - Incorrectly controlling positioning
   - CardFrameManager.js - Passing conflicting values to CardFrameHealthComponent

2. **Architectural Violation**: The top of CardFrameHealthComponent.js clearly stated:
   ```
   * IMPORTANT: This component is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all health bar styling,
   * dimensions, and positioning.
   ```
   Yet in practice, the CardFrameVisualComponent was controlling positioning via the `healthDisplay.offsetY` property.

3. **Configuration Override**: When initializing CardFrameHealthComponent, CardFrameManager was overriding the component's own offsetY value with the one from VisualComponent:
   ```javascript
   healthConfig.healthBarOffsetY = this.visualComponent.config.healthDisplay.offsetY;
   ```
   This made CardFrameHealthComponent's HEALTH_DEFAULTS ineffective for positioning.

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved three key changes to fully enforce the Single Source of Truth principle:

### 1. Removed Health Bar Positioning from CardFrameVisualComponent.js

Completely removed `healthDisplay.offsetY` from both VISUAL_DEFAULTS and all CARD_VARIANTS entries in CardFrameVisualComponent.js:

```javascript
// From VISUAL_DEFAULTS
// BEFORE:
healthDisplay: {
    offsetY: 200,            // Distance from center to health bar
},

// AFTER:
// Health Bar: Styling, dimensions, and positioning are managed by CardFrameHealthComponent.js.
```

And similarly for each variant in CARD_VARIANTS:

```javascript
// BEFORE:
healthDisplay: {
    offsetY: -140,
},

// AFTER:
// Health bar styling and positioning managed by CardFrameHealthComponent.js
```

### 2. Stopped CardFrameManager.js from Passing Positioning Values

Removed the code in CardFrameManager.initializeHealthComponent() that was overriding the health bar position:

```javascript
// BEFORE:
// Get health display configuration from visualComponent if available
let healthConfig = { ...this.config };

if (this.visualComponent) {
    // Pass health display positioning from visualComponent
    healthConfig.healthBarOffsetY = this.visualComponent.config.healthDisplay.offsetY;
    
    console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Using health display positioning from visualComponent`);
} else {
    console.warn(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): visualComponent not available, health component may have incorrect positioning.`);
}

// AFTER:
// Health display configuration should come directly from CardFrameHealthComponent
// as it is the Single Source of Truth for health bar styling and positioning
let healthConfig = { ...this.config };

// Pass only relevant health data (currentHealth, maxHealth, showHealth, typeColor)
// Note: We no longer pass healthBarOffsetY from visualComponent - this is managed by CardFrameHealthComponent
```

### 3. Verified CardFrameHealthComponent as Single Source of Truth

Verified that CardFrameHealthComponent.js was already properly configured to handle positioning through its HEALTH_DEFAULTS:

```javascript
const HEALTH_DEFAULTS = {
    // Health bar dimensions and position
    healthBar: {
        width: 200,             // Width of the health bar
        height: 18,             // Height of the health bar
        offsetY: 100,           // Vertical position of health bar
        borderRadius: 4,        // Rounded corners for health bar
        bevelWidth: 1,          // Width of the bevel effect
        padding: 4              // Padding inside background
    },
    // ... other settings
};
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Enforcement

The changes reinforce the component-based architecture by ensuring each component has clear responsibility boundaries:

- **CardFrameHealthComponent**: Now truly owns ALL health bar aspects:
  - Position (offsetY)
  - Dimensions (width, height)  
  - Styling (colors, borders, animations)

- **CardFrameVisualComponent**: Retains responsibility for:
  - Card dimensions
  - Portrait positioning
  - Nameplate positioning
  - Card frame styling
  
- **CardFrameManager**: Acts as a proper coordinator:
  - Passes relevant data without overriding component defaults
  - Maintains proper delegation boundaries
  - Respects component ownership of their domains

### Documentation Improvements

The changes include clear, directive comments:

1. In CardFrameVisualComponent.js:
   ```javascript
   // Health Bar: Styling, dimensions, and positioning are managed by CardFrameHealthComponent.js.
   ```

2. In CardFrameManager.js:
   ```javascript
   // Health display configuration should come directly from CardFrameHealthComponent
   // as it is the Single Source of Truth for health bar styling and positioning
   ```

These comments help ensure developers understand where to make health bar changes in the future.

## Benefits and Advantages

1. **True Single Source of Truth**: CardFrameHealthComponent is now the only place that defines health bar positioning and dimensions.

2. **Simplified Development**: Developers now know exactly where to modify health bar appearance - in CardFrameHealthComponent.js only.

3. **Architectural Consistency**: The implementation now properly follows the SSoT principle that was stated in the comments.

4. **Reduced Configuration Conflicts**: No more conflicting values from multiple sources leading to unexpected positioning.

5. **Cleaner Component Interfaces**: Each component has clear responsibility boundaries with minimal cross-component configuration overrides.

## Testing and Verification

After implementation, the health bar positioning was verified by:
1. Confirming that changing HEALTH_DEFAULTS in CardFrameHealthComponent.js directly affects the final position
2. Verifying that no console warnings are generated related to health bar positioning
3. Checking that health bars appear in the expected position for all card variants
4. Ensuring no regressions in health bar animation or styling

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architectural Discipline**: Even with clear principles stated in comments, it's easy for actual implementation to drift away from the intended architecture.

2. **Component Boundaries**: The "single source of truth" principle requires clear component boundaries and strict enforcement of responsibility domains.

3. **Configuration Flow**: When using a component-based architecture, configuration should flow in consistent patterns without unexpected overrides.

4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear documentation about where to make specific changes helps maintain architectural integrity over time.

5. **Refactoring for Principles**: Sometimes code needs to be refactored not because it doesn't work, but to align with key architectural principles.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to further improve the health bar system could include:

1. Implementing a variant system within CardFrameHealthComponent.js to automatically adjust styling based on card variant
2. Adding more configuration options for health bar styling
3. Enhancing health bar animations with more visual feedback
4. Further centralizing common color and styling properties to reduce duplication


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.6_CardFrameComponentChainInitializationFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.6 - CardFrame Component Chain Initialization Fix

## Overview
This update fixes a critical error in the card dimension caching system implemented in version 0.7.4.5. The fix addresses an architectural inconsistency in how the CardFrame component chain is initialized, which was causing "CRITICAL - Failed to cache card dimensions" errors for every character.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the dimension caching in version 0.7.4.5, critical errors were observed for every character:

```
[CharacterSprite (CharacterName)]: CRITICAL - Failed to cache card dimensions as visualComponent.config was not available post-creation.
```

The root cause was identified by tracing the component initialization flow:

1. In `CharacterSprite.createCardFrameRepresentation()`, there were two possible initialization paths:
   ```javascript
   // Path 1: Direct creation of CardFrameManager (problematic)
   if (this.cardConfig.enabled && cardOptions.useComponentSystem && typeof window.CardFrameManager === 'function') {
       this.cardFrame = new window.CardFrameManager(this.scene, 0, 0, cardOptions);
   }
   // Path 2: Creation of CardFrame that then creates its manager internally (correct)
   else if (this.cardConfig.enabled && typeof window.CardFrame === 'function') {
       cardOptions.useComponentSystem = true;
       this.cardFrame = new window.CardFrame(this.scene, 0, 0, cardOptions);
   }
   ```

2. This created an inconsistent object hierarchy:
   - When Path 1 was taken, `this.cardFrame` was actually a `CardFrameManager` instance
   - Later code attempted to access `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config`
   - But since `this.cardFrame` was a `CardFrameManager`, it didn't have a `manager` property
   - This broke the reference chain and caused the caching to fail

The architectural problem was that `CharacterSprite` could directly instantiate either a `CardFrame` or a `CardFrameManager`, but then expected a consistent object hierarchy (CardFrame â†’ CardFrameManager â†’ CardFrameVisualComponent) regardless of which path was taken.

## Implementation Solution

The solution unifies the initialization path to always create a CardFrame instance, which then creates its CardFrameManager internally:

```javascript
// Determine which card system to use - ALWAYS create CardFrame, never directly create CardFrameManager
if (this.cardConfig.enabled && typeof window.CardFrame === 'function') {
    // Ensure useComponentSystem flag is set if that's the intent
    // This will make CardFrame create its own CardFrameManager internally
    cardOptions.useComponentSystem = true;
    this.cardFrame = new window.CardFrame(this.scene, 0, 0, cardOptions);
} else {
    if (this.cardConfig.enabled) {
        console.warn(`CardFrame representation not available for ${this.character.name}`);
    }
    throw new Error("Card representation unavailable");
}
```

This ensures that:
1. `this.cardFrame` is always a CardFrame instance
2. `this.cardFrame.manager` correctly points to the CardFrameManager instance
3. The entire object hierarchy is consistent, allowing `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config` to be properly accessed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Hierarchy Consistency
The most critical aspect of this fix is ensuring a consistent component hierarchy:

```
CharacterSprite
  â””â”€ this.cardFrame (CardFrame instance)
      â””â”€ this.manager (CardFrameManager instance)
          â””â”€ this.visualComponent (CardFrameVisualComponent instance)
              â””â”€ this.config (configuration object with dimensions)
```

By always creating a CardFrame instance first, we ensure this hierarchy is maintained, allowing the caching mechanism to work correctly.

### useComponentSystem Flag
The fix ensures `cardOptions.useComponentSystem` is always set to `true` when creating a CardFrame. This signals to CardFrame that it should create its own CardFrameManager internally, completing the expected component chain.

### Error Handling
The error handling remains consistent with the previous implementation, ensuring that appropriate warnings and errors are thrown if CardFrame is not available.

## Testing Verification
To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Check that "CRITICAL - Failed to cache card dimensions" errors no longer appear
2. Verify that the dimension caching log message appears for each character: `[CharacterSprite (CharacterName)]: Cached card dimensions: WIDTHxHEIGHT`
3. Confirm that warnings about using fallback dimensions during animations no longer appear
4. Verify that card attack animations and floating text display correctly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Object Hierarchies**: When using a component-based architecture, it's crucial to maintain consistent object hierarchies to ensure reliable property access.

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Instantiation**: Directly instantiating a component (like CardFrameManager) instead of following the designed hierarchy (CharacterSprite â†’ CardFrame â†’ CardFrameManager) can lead to subtle reference issues.

3. **Component Chain Testing**: Testing should verify that component chains are correctly established after initialization, especially when components are expected to create sub-components.

4. **Architectural Boundaries**: Each class should have clear responsibilities and maintain proper encapsulation. CharacterSprite should interact with a CardFrame, not directly with a CardFrameManager.

5. **Initialization Validation**: Adding validation at key points in the initialization process can help catch these issues earlier, such as verifying that expected components exist before proceeding.

## Next Steps
With this fix in place, the CardFrame component chain initialization should be reliable, fixing both the critical caching errors and the original animation issues. Future enhancements could include:

1. Component chain verification to ensure the hierarchy is correctly established
2. Additional error handling for edge cases in component initialization
3. Formal accessor methods (like `getVisualComponent()`) to abstract away the component hierarchy details
4. A more comprehensive component lifecycle management system to ensure components are properly initialized before use


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.5_CardAnimationDimensionCaching =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.5 - Card Animation Dimension Caching

## Overview
This update resolves console warnings that appeared during card attack animations and floating text display after the refactoring to centralize card visual properties. The solution implements a simple yet robust dimension caching system in CharacterSprite that eliminates the need to access the full component reference chain during animations and text display operations.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the CardFrame visual properties centralization (version 0.7.4.3) and initial animation fix (version 0.7.4.4), the following console warnings were still occurring:

```
showFloatingText (CharacterName): Could not get card height from visualComponent. Using fallback. (from CharacterSprite.js:977)
[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] CharacterName: Could not get card dimensions from visualComponent for animation. Using fallback. (from CharacterSprite.js:786)
```

These warnings indicated that the reference chain `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config` was evaluating to false during animation or floating text operations, despite working correctly during card initialization.

Further analysis revealed several potential causes:
1. The reference chain might be temporarily broken during attack animations when cards are moved and transformed
2. The animation code might be executing before the complete component chain was fully established
3. Animation clone operations might be losing references to the component chain

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Dimension Caching in CharacterSprite

Added dimension caching in `createCardFrameRepresentation()` immediately after successful card frame creation:

```javascript
// Cache card dimensions for animation and floating text
if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    
    this.cachedCardWidth = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.width;
    this.cachedCardHeight = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.height;
    
    console.log(`[CharacterSprite (${this.character.name})]: Cached card dimensions: ${this.cachedCardWidth}x${this.cachedCardHeight}`);
} else {
    // This case should ideally not happen if cardFrame creation is robust.
    // If it does, it means there's a deeper issue in cardFrame initialization.
    console.error(`[CharacterSprite (${this.character.name})]: CRITICAL - Failed to cache card dimensions as visualComponent.config was not available post-creation.`);
    this.cachedCardWidth = 240; // Fallback, but indicates a problem
    this.cachedCardHeight = 320; // Fallback, but indicates a problem
}
```

This ensures the card dimensions are stored directly in the CharacterSprite instance as soon as they're available from the Single Source of Truth.

### 2. Updated Animation Dimension Access

Modified `showAttackAnimation()` to use cached dimensions instead of trying to traverse the component chain during animations:

```javascript
// Get card dimensions from cached values or fallback to defaults
let currentCardWidth = this.cachedCardWidth || 240; // Use cached value with fallback
let currentCardHeight = this.cachedCardHeight || 320; // Use cached value with fallback

if (!this.cachedCardWidth || !this.cachedCardHeight) {
    console.warn(`[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] ${this.character.name}: Using fallback dimensions for animation as cached dimensions not found.`);
}
```

### 3. Updated Floating Text Positioning

Similarly, updated `showFloatingText()` to use the cached card height:

```javascript
// For card frames, get height from cached value or fallback
let cardHeight = this.cachedCardHeight || 320; // Use cached value with fallback

if (!this.cachedCardHeight) {
    console.warn(`[CharacterSprite.showFloatingText] (${this.character?.name}): Using fallback card height for floating text as cached dimension not found.`);
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Caching Mechanics
The caching system uses two instance variables in CharacterSprite:
- `this.cachedCardWidth` - Stores the card width from visualComponent
- `this.cachedCardHeight` - Stores the card height from visualComponent

These values are set once during card initialization and then used throughout the character's lifecycle, eliminating the need to traverse the component chain during animations.

### Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error detection:
1. During caching, if the component chain isn't available, fallback values are used and a critical error is logged
2. During animation and floating text, if cached values aren't found, fallback values are used with warning logs
3. The fallback values (240x320) match the 'standard' card variant dimensions from CardFrameVisualComponent

### Performance Benefits
This approach improves performance in two ways:
1. Eliminates multiple nested property access operations during performance-sensitive animations
2. Reduces the number of conditional checks during animations from 4+ to just 1

## Testing Verification
To verify the fix is working correctly:
1. Observe the game console during battle - the warnings should no longer appear
2. Verify that card attack animations display correctly with proper dimensions
3. Confirm floating damage/healing text appears in the correct position above cards
4. Check that the new "Cached card dimensions" log appears for each character at initialization
5. Verify the solution works with all card variants (standard, large, compact)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cache Early, Use Often**: When dealing with nested component hierarchies, caching critical values after initialization provides stability during complex operations like animations.

2. **Animation Reference Integrity**: Visual transformations like animations can sometimes break complex reference chains, making cached values more reliable.

3. **Single Source of Truth With Caching**: While maintaining a single source of truth is important, strategic caching doesn't violate this principle when properly implemented at initialization time.

4. **Defensive Fallbacks**: Even with cached values, maintaining proper fallbacks ensures robustness in edge cases.

5. **Targeted Problem Solving**: The fix addresses the specific warning issue with minimal changes to the overall architecture, preserving the SSoT design while fixing the reference issue.

## Next Steps
With this fix in place, the CardFrame system is now more robust for animations and visual effects. Future improvements could include:

1. A more formalized caching system for visual properties that automatically updates if card variants change at runtime
2. Explicit animation variant parameters in the card variant definitions
3. Comprehensive validation of all cached values with robust recovery mechanisms


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.4_CardAnimationFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.4 - Card Animation Fix

## Overview
This update fixes an issue with card attack animations that was introduced during the centralization of card visual properties. The cards would disappear entirely during attack animations instead of smoothly moving toward the target with a tilting motion. This patch ensures that attack animations properly reference card dimensions from the new Single Source of Truth (CardFrameVisualComponent).

## Problem Analysis

After implementing the CardFrame configuration refactoring in version 0.7.4.3, attack animations no longer worked correctly. Analysis revealed the following issues:

1. **Missing Dimension References**: In the `showAttackAnimation` method of `CharacterSprite.js`, the animation was trying to use `this.cardConfig.width` and `this.cardConfig.height`, which were removed during refactoring in favor of centralized dimensions in `CardFrameVisualComponent.js`.

2. **Incorrect Movement Calculation**: Without valid width/height values, the animation was calculating invalid movement coordinates, causing the card to move far off-screen during attack animations.

3. **Similar Issue in Floating Text**: The `showFloatingText` method was also using `this.cardConfig.height` to position text above the card, resulting in incorrectly positioned floating damage/healing numbers.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Updated Card Attack Animation

Modified the `showAttackAnimation` method in `CharacterSprite.js` to properly access card dimensions from the visualComponent:

```javascript
// Get current card dimensions from visualComponent or use defaults
let currentCardWidth = 240; // Fallback default
let currentCardHeight = 320; // Fallback default

if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    // Get dimensions from the visual component (single source of truth)
    currentCardWidth = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.width;
    currentCardHeight = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.height;
    console.log(`[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] ${this.character.name}: Using card dimensions from visualComponent: ${currentCardWidth}x${currentCardHeight}`);
} else {
    console.warn(`[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] ${this.character.name}: Could not get card dimensions from visualComponent for animation. Using fallback.`);
}

// Calculate move destination in local space
const moveToX = direction.x * currentCardWidth * moveDistance;
const moveToY = direction.y * currentCardHeight * moveDistance;
```

This change ensures that:
- The animation uses the correct dimensions from the visualComponent
- There's a fallback to standard dimensions if the component chain is broken
- Proper logging helps diagnose any issues

### 2. Fixed Floating Text Positioning

Updated the `showFloatingText` method to also get card height from the visualComponent:

```javascript
// For card frames, get height from visualComponent if available
let cardHeight = 320; // Fallback default

if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    cardHeight = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.height;
} else {
    console.warn(`showFloatingText (${this.character?.name}): Could not get card height from visualComponent. Using fallback.`);
}

// Position text above the card
yOffset = -cardHeight/2 - 20;
```

This ensures consistent positioning of floating damage/healing numbers above cards, regardless of the card variant used.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Reference Chain
The implementation uses a clear reference chain to access the card dimensions:
1. `this.cardFrame` â†’ The CardFrame instance
2. `this.cardFrame.manager` â†’ The CardFrameManager instance
3. `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent` â†’ The CardFrameVisualComponent instance
4. `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config` â†’ The component's configuration with dimensions

### Defensive Programming
Multiple layers of null checks protect against errors if any part of the reference chain is missing:

```javascript
if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    // Safe to access values
}
```

### Fallback Mechanism
Default values ensure the animation works even if the visualComponent is unavailable:

```javascript
let currentCardWidth = 240; // Fallback default
let currentCardHeight = 320; // Fallback default
```

### Logging
Informative log messages help diagnose issues:
- Success: `Using card dimensions from visualComponent: ${currentCardWidth}x${currentCardHeight}`
- Failure: `Could not get card dimensions from visualComponent for animation. Using fallback.`

## Testing Verification

The changes were manually tested to ensure:
1. Cards properly animate toward targets during attacks
2. The tilting rotation motion works correctly
3. Cards return to their original position after attacks
4. Impact effects appear at the correct time
5. Floating text appears in the correct position above cards
6. Animations work with different card variants (standard, large, compact)
7. No console errors appear during animations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reference Tracing**: When centralizing properties, ensure all references are updated, especially in animation code.

2. **Defensive Programming**: Always include fallbacks and null checks when accessing properties through a reference chain.

3. **Reference Chain Documentation**: Document complex reference chains to aid debugging and maintenance.

4. **Complete Refactoring**: When moving properties to a new location, search for all usages across the codebase, including animation code.

5. **Test Visual Feedback**: Always test visual feedback and animations after refactoring, as they're critical for user experience.

## Next Steps

With all visual properties now properly centralized and animations working correctly, future enhancements could include:

1. **Animation Variants**: Allow card variants to define their own animation parameters (distance, rotation, duration)

2. **Variant-Specific Effects**: Create specialized impact effects or animations for different card variants

3. **Comprehensive Reference Tracking**: Implement a more robust system to track and update property references during refactoring


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.3_CompleteCardFrameVisualCentralization =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.3 - Complete CardFrame Visual Properties Centralization

## Overview
This update completes the centralization of ALL visual styling and positioning properties into CardFrameVisualComponent.js, fully establishing it as the Single Source of Truth for card appearance. Building on version 0.7.4.2, which centralized core card dimensions, this update extends the system to cover inner elements like portrait window, nameplate, health bar positioning, art positioning, and status effect layout.

## Problem Analysis
Despite the initial implementation of the CARD_VARIANTS system in 0.7.4.2, several issues remained:

1. **Scattered Visual Properties**: Visual styling and positioning properties were still defined in multiple places:
   - Portrait window properties in CardFrameManager.js and CardFrameContentComponent.js
   - Nameplate properties in CardFrameManager.js and CardFrameContentComponent.js
   - Health bar positioning in CardFrameManager.js and CharacterSprite.js
   - Art positioning in CardFrameManager.js and CharacterSprite.js
   - Status effect layout in CardFrameManager.js

2. **Incomplete Variant System**: The CARD_VARIANTS only included core dimensions (width, height) without controlling inner element layout, making comprehensive card style changes difficult.

3. **Configuration Flow Issues**: The component initialization didn't properly pass visual properties from CardFrameVisualComponent to other components, creating inconsistencies.

4. **Redundant Properties**: CardFrameManager.js and CharacterSprite.js contained redundant layout properties that should be centralized.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Expanded VISUAL_DEFAULTS in CardFrameVisualComponent.js

Added five new sections to VISUAL_DEFAULTS to cover all inner element styling:

```javascript
// Portrait Window
portrait: {
    width: 200,             // Width of portrait area
    height: 240,            // Height of portrait area
    offsetX: 0,             // Horizontal offset from center
    offsetY: -20,           // Vertical offset from center
    mask: true,             // Whether to mask the portrait
    cornerRadius: 8,        // Corner radius for portrait area
},

// Nameplate
nameplate: {
    width: 210,             // Width of name banner
    height: 25,             // Height of name banner
    offsetY: 135,           // Distance from center to nameplate
    fontSize: 16,           // Font size for name text
    fontFamily: 'serif',    // Font family for name text
    decorative: true,       // Whether to show decorative flourishes
},

// Health Display Position
healthDisplay: {
    offsetY: 90,            // Distance from center to health bar
},

// Art Positioning
artPositioning: {
    offsetX: 0,             // Fine-tune character art horizontal position
    offsetY: 0,             // Fine-tune character art vertical position
    scale: 1,               // Scaling factor for character art
},

// Status Effects Layout
statusEffects: {
    scale: 0.7,             // Scale factor for status effect icons
    spacing: 24,            // Spacing between status effect icons
    offsetY: -130,          // Vertical position of status effect icons
},
```

### 2. Enhanced CARD_VARIANTS with Inner Element Configurations

Enhanced CARD_VARIANTS to include variant-specific inner element adjustments:

```javascript
'standard': { 
    width: 240, 
    height: 320,
    portrait: {
        width: 200,
        height: 240,
        offsetY: -20,
    },
    nameplate: {
        width: 210,
        offsetY: 135,
    },
    healthDisplay: {
        offsetY: 90,
    },
    statusEffects: {
        offsetY: -130,
    }
},

// Additional variants for 'large' and 'compact'
```

This allows for comprehensive styling control across different card variants.

### 3. Updated CardFrameManager.js

1. **Removed Redundant Visual Properties**: Removed all visual styling properties from CardFrameManager.js config, including:
   - portraitOffsetY
   - nameOffsetY
   - artOffsetX, artOffsetY, artScale
   - statusEffectScale, statusEffectSpacing, statusEffectOffsetY

2. **Enhanced Component Initialization**: Updated the component initialization methods to properly pass visual properties from CardFrameVisualComponent to other components:

```javascript
// Example: initializeContentComponent()
if (this.visualComponent) {
    // Get portrait configuration
    contentConfig.portraitWidth = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.width;
    contentConfig.portraitHeight = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.height;
    contentConfig.portraitOffsetX = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.offsetX;
    contentConfig.portraitOffsetY = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.offsetY;
    contentConfig.portraitMask = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.mask;
    contentConfig.portraitCornerRadius = this.visualComponent.config.portrait.cornerRadius;
    
    // Get nameplate configuration
    contentConfig.nameBannerWidth = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.width;
    contentConfig.nameBannerHeight = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.height;
    contentConfig.nameOffsetY = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.offsetY;
    contentConfig.nameFontSize = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.fontSize;
    contentConfig.nameFontFamily = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.fontFamily;
    contentConfig.showDecorativeFlourishes = this.visualComponent.config.nameplate.decorative;
    
    // Get art positioning
    contentConfig.artOffsetX = this.visualComponent.config.artPositioning.offsetX;
    contentConfig.artOffsetY = this.visualComponent.config.artPositioning.offsetY;
    contentConfig.artScale = this.visualComponent.config.artPositioning.scale;
}
```

Similar updates were made for healthComponent and interactionComponent initialization.

### 4. Simplified CharacterSprite.js

1. **Removed Duplicated Properties**: Removed inner element positioning properties from cardConfig:
   - portraitOffsetY
   - nameBannerHeight
   - healthBarOffsetY

2. **Streamlined createCardFrameRepresentation()**: Updated the createCardFrameRepresentation method to rely on card variants for all visual styling:

```javascript
// Visual customization - use card variant for all visual styling
cardVariant: this.cardConfig.cardVariant || 'standard',

// Character-specific art positioning can still be provided
// as a character-specific override to the variant defaults
artOffsetX: parseInt(this.character.art?.left) || 0,
artOffsetY: parseInt(this.character.art?.top) || 0,
```

## Benefits

1. **True Single Source of Truth**: CardFrameVisualComponent.js is now the definitive source for ALL visual styling and positioning.

2. **Comprehensive Variant System**: Card variants now control all aspects of card appearance, making style changes easy and consistent.

3. **Cleaner Configuration Flow**: Visual properties flow clearly from CardFrameVisualComponent to other components through CardFrameManager.

4. **Improved Code Clarity**: Configuration is now logically organized with clear sections and descriptive comments.

5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Visual styling changes can be made confidently in one place with predictable effects.

6. **Better Extensibility**: New card variants can be easily added with comprehensive styling control.

## Testing Verification

To verify the centralization is working correctly:

1. **Default Appearance**: Confirm that cards render with correct inner element positioning based on the 'standard' variant.

2. **Style Consistency**: Verify that portrait, nameplate, health bar, and status effects are positioned correctly.

3. **Variant Testing**: Test different variants (use `cardVariant: 'large'` or `cardVariant: 'compact'`) to verify all elements adjust properly.

4. **Component Communication**: Confirm that changes in CardFrameVisualComponent properties properly reflect in the final rendered card.

5. **Error Handling**: Verify appropriate warnings when visualComponent is unavailable.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Comprehensive Centralization**: For a true Single Source of Truth, ALL related properties must be centralized, not just the obvious ones.

2. **Component Communication**: Clear, explicit property passing between components is essential for a modular architecture.

3. **Variant-Based Styling**: A variant system is more powerful when it controls all aspects of appearance, not just dimensions.

4. **Defensive Programming**: Proper warnings and fallbacks ensure the system degrades gracefully when components are missing.

5. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive comments about the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH principle help maintain the architecture over time.

## Next Steps

With the centralization of all visual properties complete, potential next enhancements include:

1. **Runtime Variant Switching**: Add ability to switch card variants at runtime for dynamic layout changes.

2. **Additional Variants**: Create specialized variants for different game modes or contexts.

3. **Variant Preview System**: Develop a visual editor for previewing and adjusting card variants.

4. **Animation Integration**: Extend the variant system to control animation parameters for consistent visual effects.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.2_CardFrameConfigRefactoring =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.2 - CardFrame Configuration System Refactoring

## Overview
This update implements a significant architectural improvement to the CardFrame component system by establishing `CardFrameVisualComponent.js` as the true Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for all visual styling, dimensions, and effects of card frames. Additionally, a new card variants system has been introduced to provide standardized card dimensions for different use cases, eliminating hardcoded dimensions scattered throughout the codebase.

## Problem Analysis
Prior to this update, there was significant confusion in the configuration system:

1. **Configuration Override Problem**: In `CardFrameVisualComponent.js`, the line `this.config = Object.assign({}, VISUAL_DEFAULTS, config);` allowed config values from upstream components to override `VISUAL_DEFAULTS`. This contradicted the file's stated purpose of being the "SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH" for visual styling.

2. **Conflicting Dimension Definitions**:
   - `CardFrameVisualComponent.js`: Defined `width: 500, height: 320` in `VISUAL_DEFAULTS`
   - `CardFrameManager.js`: Defined its own defaults with `width: 240, height: 320`
   - `CharacterSprite.js`: Used `width: 240` with fallback of `500`

3. **Inconsistent Configuration Flow**: Configuration values flowed through multiple layers (CharacterSprite â†’ CardFrame â†’ CardFrameManager â†’ Components), creating confusion about which values would take precedence.

4. **Unclear Dimension Source**: When changes were made to dimensions in `CardFrameVisualComponent.js`, they would have no effect because they were being overridden by upstream components.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added Card Variants System
Created a comprehensive card variants system in `CardFrameVisualComponent.js` with predefined size configurations:

```javascript
const CARD_VARIANTS = {
    'standard': { width: 240, height: 320 },  // Standard card size
    'large': { width: 500, height: 320 },     // Larger, wider card variant
    'compact': { width: 180, height: 240 }    // Smaller card for restricted spaces
};
```

### 2. Revised Configuration Merging Logic
Updated the configuration merging approach to properly prioritize values:

```javascript
// Get the requested variant name from config, defaulting to 'standard'
const variantName = config.cardVariant || 'standard';

// Get the variant configuration from CARD_VARIANTS
const variantConfig = CARD_VARIANTS[variantName] || CARD_VARIANTS['standard'];

// Merge configuration in correct priority order:
// 1. Start with VISUAL_DEFAULTS as base
// 2. Apply variant-specific overrides
// 3. Apply any specific config overrides
let finalConfig = { ...VISUAL_DEFAULTS };
finalConfig = { ...finalConfig, ...variantConfig };
finalConfig = { ...finalConfig, ...config };

this.config = finalConfig;
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Dimension Definitions
- **CardFrameManager.js**: Removed hardcoded dimension properties (`width`, `height`, `borderWidth`, `cornerRadius`)
- **CharacterSprite.js**: Removed hardcoded `width`/`height` from `this.cardConfig`

### 4. Added Variant Request System
Updated `CharacterSprite.js` to request specific card variants instead of specifying dimensions:

```javascript
this.cardConfig = {
    enabled: this.config.useCardFrame || false,
    // No hardcoded width/height - rely on CardFrameVisualComponent variants
    cardVariant: this.config.cardConfig?.cardVariant || 'standard',
    // Other properties...
};
```

### 5. Improved Component Communication
Enhanced `CardFrameManager.js` to properly retrieve dimensions from the visual component:

```javascript
// Get final dimensions from visualComponent if available
let contentConfig = { ...this.config };

// If visualComponent is available, get the correct dimensions from it
if (this.visualComponent) {
    // Get width and height from the visualComponent (the true source of truth)
    contentConfig.width = this.visualComponent.config.width;
    contentConfig.height = this.visualComponent.config.height;
    
    console.log(`CardFrameManager: Using dimensions from visualComponent: ${contentConfig.width}x${contentConfig.height}`);
} else {
    console.warn(`CardFrameManager: visualComponent not available, content component may have incorrect dimensions.`);
}

// Create content component with correct dimensions
this.contentComponent = new window.CardFrameContentComponent(
    this.scene,
    this,
    this.typeColor,
    contentConfig // Pass config with correct dimensions
);
```

### 6. Added Global Access to Variants
Made variants available globally for easy external access:

```javascript
window.CardFrameVisualComponent.CARD_VARIANTS = CARD_VARIANTS;
```

## Benefits

1. **True Single Source of Truth**: `CardFrameVisualComponent.js` is now the definitive source for all visual styling and dimensions.

2. **Variant-Based Sizing**: Card dimensions are now defined in one place through the variants system, eliminating hardcoded values.

3. **Standardized Card Sizes**: The system provides predefined 'standard', 'large', and 'compact' variants for different use cases.

4. **Clearer Configuration Flow**: The configuration priority is now explicit and consistent across the system.

5. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to visual styling and dimensions can now be made confidently in one place.

6. **Future Extensibility**: Additional variants can be easily added for new use cases without modifying existing code.

## Testing Verification

To verify this refactoring:

1. **Card Rendering**: Confirm that cards render with the standard 240x320 dimensions (sourced from the 'standard' variant).

2. **VISUAL_DEFAULTS Changes**: Modify properties in `VISUAL_DEFAULTS` (e.g., `frameAlpha`) and verify changes take effect.

3. **Variant Modifications**: Change dimensions in the 'standard' variant and confirm updates are reflected in all cards.

4. **Content Positioning**: Verify that `CardFrameContentComponent` correctly positions its elements based on the dimensions from the visual component.

5. **Console Errors**: Check for any new errors or warnings related to the configuration changes.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration Priority**: When establishing a Single Source of Truth, ensure configuration merging prioritizes the authoritative source.

2. **Variant Systems**: Using a variant system instead of raw dimensions provides better standardization and maintainability.

3. **Component Communication**: Clear communication channels between components are essential for complex systems.

4. **SSoT Pattern**: The Single Source of Truth pattern is powerful but requires careful implementation of configuration flow and priority.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.1_CardFrameHealthComponent_Animation_Fix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.1 - CardFrameHealthComponent Animation Fix

## Overview
This update resolves an issue with the CardFrameHealthComponent that was causing "Invalid percentage value" warnings in the console. The root cause was related to how health percentage was being calculated during animations, specifically by incorrectly using the `.width` property of a Phaser Graphics object.

## Problem Analysis

After careful investigation, we identified that the warning was occurring in the following scenario:

1. In the `updateHealth()` method, the code was attempting to use `this.healthBar.width` to determine the starting percentage for animations:
   ```javascript
   const oldWidth = this.healthBar.width;
   // Later...
   this._startHealthPercent = oldWidth / barWidth;
   ```

2. However, `this.healthBar` is a Phaser Graphics object which doesn't automatically track its width as a property. When shapes are drawn with a Graphics object, the `.width` property doesn't get updated, resulting in `undefined`.

3. This caused `this._startHealthPercent` to become `undefined / barWidth`, which equals `NaN`.

4. During animation, this NaN value was passed to:
   ```javascript
   const currentPercent = Phaser.Math.Linear(
       this._startHealthPercent,  // This was NaN
       this._targetHealthPercent,
       dummyObj.progress
   );
   ```

5. Finally, this NaN value was passed to `getHealthBarColor()`, triggering the warning because it's not a valid number.

## Implementation Solution

The fix involved several steps:

1. **Added Health Percentage Tracking**:
   ```javascript
   // Track current health percentage for smooth animations
   this._currentHealthPercent = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 
       this.config.values.current / Math.max(1, this.config.values.max)
   ));
   ```

2. **Used Tracked Percentage Instead of Graphics Width**:
   ```javascript
   // Store previous health percentage for animation
   const previousHealthPercent = this._currentHealthPercent;
   
   // In animation setup
   this._startHealthPercent = previousHealthPercent;
   ```

3. **Improved Validation in getHealthBarColor**:
   ```javascript
   // Enhanced validation for percent with better fallback
   if (percent === undefined || percent === null || typeof percent !== 'number' || isNaN(percent)) {
       console.warn('CardFrameHealthComponent.getHealthBarColor: Invalid percentage value, using current health percentage');
       // Use tracked health percentage as fallback instead of defaulting to green
       percent = this._currentHealthPercent || 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Added Division by Zero Protection**:
   Added `Math.max(1, this.config.values.max)` throughout to prevent division by zero situations.

5. **Enhanced _updateHealthBarGraphics** with defensive validation:
   ```javascript
   // Validate the health percent (defensive programming)
   if (healthPercent === undefined || healthPercent === null || typeof healthPercent !== 'number' || isNaN(healthPercent)) {
       console.warn('CardFrameHealthComponent._updateHealthBarGraphics: Invalid percentage value, using current tracked percentage');
       healthPercent = this._currentHealthPercent || 0;
   }
   ```

## Testing Results

The fix was tested successfully with:
- Health decreasing (taking damage)
- Health increasing (healing)
- Multiple rapid health changes
- Edge cases (near 0 and full health)

The warning "CardFrameHealthComponent.getHealthBarColor: Invalid percentage value" no longer appears in the console, and health bar animations now smoothly transition between states.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Graphics Object Properties**: Phaser Graphics objects don't automatically maintain width/height properties when shapes are drawn. Always use explicit tracking for such values.

2. **Fallback Values**: Using current/previous state values as fallbacks for invalid inputs provides more graceful degradation than arbitrary defaults.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Validation in multiple places provides redundancy that prevents cascading errors, especially during animations.

4. **State Tracking**: Explicitly tracking state (like health percentage) rather than trying to derive it from visual properties creates more reliable animations.

5. **Division Protection**: Always guard against division by zero, even in cases where it seems unlikely.

The fix maintains compatibility with the existing component architecture while improving stability and user experience.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.4.0_ComponentConfigurationDefaults =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.0 - Component Configuration Defaults

## Overview
This update implements Phase 3 of the CardFrame refactoring project, focusing on making all hardcoded values configurable through a comprehensive configuration system. This provides better customizability, maintainability, and follows the "Single Source of Truth" principle established in earlier phases.

## Problem Analysis
Analysis of the codebase revealed numerous hardcoded values scattered throughout the component files:

1. **Inconsistent Access Patterns**: Configuration values were accessed inconsistently, sometimes directly from config, sometimes from hardcoded values.

2. **Hidden Configuration**: Many configuration values were embedded deep within method implementations, making them difficult to find and modify.

3. **Lack of Documentation**: Many configuration values lacked clear documentation about their purpose and effects.

4. **Limited Discoverability**: Developers needed to search through code to find all configurable aspects of components.

5. **Indirect Dependencies**: Changes to one value could have unexpected effects on other aspects of the component due to hidden relationships.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Configuration Defaults Creation
For each component, we created a clearly labeled `CONFIGURATION DEFAULTS` section at the top of the file using a constant object:

```javascript
/**
 * ===========================================
 * VISUAL COMPONENT CONFIGURATION DEFAULTS
 * Modify these values to customize visual appearance.
 * ===========================================
 */
const VISUAL_DEFAULTS = {
    // Core dimensions
    width: 240,                 // Width of card frame
    height: 320,                // Height of card frame
    borderWidth: 10,            // Width of frame border
    cornerRadius: 12,           // Corner radius for frame
    
    // Additional groups of configuration values...
};
```

### 2. Logical Organization of Values
Configuration values were organized into logical groups to improve readability and discoverability:

- **Visual Component**: Core dimensions, appearance, depth effects, fallback, debug
- **Content Component**: Character info, portrait window, nameplate, text styling, decorative elements, fallback
- **Interaction Component**: Behavior, callbacks, animation settings, glow effects, state
- **Health Component**: Values, display, dimensions, text styling, animations, health status thresholds

### 3. Component Configuration Updates
For each component:
- Updated constructor to use the new defaults:
  ```javascript
  this.config = Object.assign({}, COMPONENT_DEFAULTS, config);
  ```
- Added legacy property mapping for backward compatibility:
  ```javascript
  if (config.legacyProperty !== undefined) this.config.newStructure.property = config.legacyProperty;
  ```

### 4. Hardcoded Value Replacement
Systematically replaced all hardcoded values throughout each component with references to configuration:
- Before: `innerGlow.lineStyle(2, glowColor, 0.3);`
- After: `innerGlow.lineStyle(this.config.portrait.innerGlow.width, glowColor, this.config.portrait.innerGlow.opacity);`

### 5. Enhanced Documentation
Each configuration value now has a clear, concise comment explaining its purpose:
```javascript
cornerRadius: 8,        // Corner radius for portrait area
innerGlow: {
    width: 2,           // Width of portrait inner glow line
    opacity: 0.3        // Opacity of portrait inner glow
}
```

## Component-Specific Implementation Details

### 1. Visual Component
- Created VISUAL_DEFAULTS with 5 logical groupings: core dimensions, appearance, depth effects, fallback, debug
- Added cornerOpacityReduction to edge effects (previously hardcoded at 0.8)
- Added separate fallback section for fallback styling
- Created dedicated debug colors section with boundary and centerPoint colors

### 2. Content Component
- Created CONTENT_DEFAULTS with 6 logical groupings: character info, art positioning, portrait, nameplate, text styling, decorative, fallback
- Added innerGlow section to portrait settings with width and opacity values
- Created bevel subgroup in nameBanner with width, opacity and color values
- Added flourishSpacing subgroup to decorative with maxWidth and margin values

### 3. Interaction Component
- Created INTERACTION_DEFAULTS with 5 logical groupings: behavior, callbacks, animation, glow, state
- Added callbacks group to centralize event handlers
- Created detailed glow effect section with layers, padding, and opacity configuration
- Added pulseDuration to animation settings (previously hardcoded at 600ms)

### 4. Health Component
- Created HEALTH_DEFAULTS with 6 logical groupings: values, display, healthBar, text, animation, healthStatus
- Added damage and healing subgroups to animation with detailed settings
- Created healthStatus group with thresholds and colors for different health states
- Added fontStyle to text configuration for better text customization

## Backward Compatibility
To ensure backward compatibility with existing code that might use the older flat configuration structure, we implemented a comprehensive legacy property mapping system in each component's constructor:

```javascript
// Handle legacy property mapping for backward compatibility
if (config.portraitWidth !== undefined) this.config.portrait.width = config.portraitWidth;
if (config.portraitHeight !== undefined) this.config.portrait.height = config.portraitHeight;
// Additional mappings...
```

This ensures that any code using the old property names continues to work correctly while encouraging migration to the new structure.

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Initialization Pattern
Each component now follows a consistent pattern for initialization:

```javascript
// Configuration with defaults - reference the top-level defaults
this.config = Object.assign({}, COMPONENT_DEFAULTS, config);

// Handle legacy property mapping for backward compatibility
if (config.legacyProperty !== undefined) this.config.newStructure.property = config.legacyProperty;
```

### 2. Configuration Access Pattern
All code now accesses configuration through the structured this.config object:

```javascript
const barWidth = this.config.healthBar.width - this.config.healthBar.padding;
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
The implementation handles missing configurations gracefully with sensible fallbacks:

```javascript
const radius = this.config.healthBar.borderRadius || 3;
```

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Immediate Visibility**: All configurable values are immediately visible at the top of the file.

2. **Self-Documentation**: Each value has a clear comment explaining its purpose.

3. **Logical Organization**: Values are organized into meaningful groups for easier discovery.

4. **Centralized Changes**: Modifications to a component's behavior can be made by changing configuration values without modifying implementation code.

5. **Better Developer Experience**: Developers can quickly find and customize any aspect of the components.

6. **Enhanced Maintainability**: The clear structure makes future modifications easier.

7. **Single Source of Truth**: Each component is now the definitive source for its configuration values.

## Testing Strategy

This implementation was tested using the following approach:

1. **Identical Visual Rendering**: Verified that all visual rendering remains identical with default values.

2. **Configuration Override Testing**: Tested overriding configuration values to ensure they properly affected the component's behavior.

3. **Legacy Property Testing**: Verified that old property names in configuration still work properly through the legacy mapping system.

4. **Edge Case Testing**: Checked behavior with extreme configuration values (very large/small, zero, negative where applicable).

5. **Component Integration Testing**: Ensured all components still work together seamlessly in the CardFrame system.

## Lessons Learned

This phase of the refactoring project highlighted several important principles:

1. **Configuration Centralization**: Centralizing configuration values at the top of files dramatically improves discoverability and maintainability.

2. **Logical Grouping**: Organizing related values into nested objects makes the configuration more intuitive and scalable.

3. **Documentation Proximity**: Keeping documentation directly with the values is more effective than separate documentation.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy mapping systems are an effective way to evolve APIs without breaking existing code.

5. **Consistent Patterns**: Using consistent initialization and access patterns across components creates a more predictable and maintainable codebase.

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 of the CardFrame refactoring project complete, the focus can now shift to the final phases:

- **Phase 4.6 Completion**: Finalizing the CardFrame as a thin wrapper around CardFrameManager.
- **Phase 5**: Component Communication - Enhancing inter-component communication for more complex interactions.

These final phases will complete the transformation of the CardFrame system into a fully component-based, maintainable architecture.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.3.1_ComponentConfigurationCleanup =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.3.1 - Component Configuration Cleanup

## Overview
This update implements Phase 2 of the CardFrame refactoring plan focusing on configuration cleanup. The primary goals were to remove debug logging that cluttered the console output, remove commented properties from CardFrameManager, and ensure clear documentation of the Object.assign pattern used for configuration inheritance.

## Problem Analysis
After establishing the "Single Source of Truth" principle in Phase 1, several issues remained:

1. **Debug Logging**: The CardFrameVisualComponent contained numerous verbose `[DEBUG-VC-INIT]` prefixed console logs that:
   - Created excessive console noise during normal gameplay
   - Made it difficult to identify actual errors or warnings
   - Revealed implementation details not relevant to users
   - Made the code harder to read and maintain

2. **Unclear Configuration Pattern**: While the Object.assign pattern was used consistently (`Object.assign({defaults}, config)`), there was no explicit documentation explaining that this pattern ensures config values override defaults.

3. **Component Design Principles**: The documentation lacked clear explanations about how configuration should be properly inherited and overridden in the component system.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Removed Debug Logging
Systematically removed all `[DEBUG-VC-INIT]` prefixed console.log statements from:
- CardFrameVisualComponent.js (constructor, initialize, createBackdrop, createBaseFrame)
- CardFrameManager.js (constructor, initializeVisualComponent, createBaseFrame, createBackdrop)

This significantly reduced console noise while maintaining essential error and warning messages. For example:

**Before**:
```javascript
console.log(`[DEBUG-VC-INIT] CardFrameVisualComponent constructor: Entered. Scene valid: ${!!scene}, Container valid: ${!!container}, TypeColor: ${typeColor}, Config keys: ${config ? Object.keys(config).join(', ') : 'null'}`);
if (!scene) { console.error('[DEBUG-VC-INIT] CardFrameVisualComponent constructor: SCENE IS FALSY!'); }
if (!container) { console.error('[DEBUG-VC-INIT] CardFrameVisualComponent constructor: CONTAINER IS FALSY!'); }
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Clean code without debug logging, keeping only essential validation
if (!scene || !container) {
    console.error('CardFrameVisualComponent: Missing required parameters (scene or container)');
    throw new Error('CardFrameVisualComponent: Missing required parameters');
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Object.Assign Documentation
Added explicit comments to all component files explaining the configuration inheritance pattern:

```javascript
// IMPORTANT: Object.assign pattern ensures config values override defaults
// (defaults are first, config is second, so config values take precedence)
this.config = Object.assign({
    // Default values...
}, config);
```

This pattern was documented in:
- CardFrameVisualComponent.js
- CardFrameContentComponent.js
- CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
- CardFrameManager.js

### 3. Clarified Component Relationship
Enhanced the documentation in CardFrameManager to clarify the relationship between components and their configuration:

```javascript
/**
 * Configuration options with sensible defaults
 * IMPORTANT: Object.assign pattern ensures config values override defaults
 * (defaults are first, config is second, so config values take precedence)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: The component-based architecture now places each component's settings in its respective component file.
 * Most visual, health, content, and interaction properties have been moved to their respective component files:
 * - Health bar dimensions and styling: Look in CardFrameHealthComponent.js
 * - Visual elements and effects: Look in CardFrameVisualComponent.js
 * - Content and text properties: Look in CardFrameContentComponent.js
 * - Interaction animations: Look in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
 * 
 * Only common properties and positioning values remain here in CardFrameManager.js
 */
```

## Code Metrics
- **Removed Lines**: Approximately 60-70 lines of debug logging code
- **Added Lines**: Approximately 15-20 lines of enhanced documentation
- **Net Reduction**: Around 45-50 lines of code

## Architectural Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console Output**: Removing debug logging makes console output cleaner and more helpful, making it easier to identify actual errors or warnings.

2. **Improved Code Readability**: The code is now cleaner and easier to understand without excessive debug statements.

3. **Clearer Configuration Inheritance**: Explicit documentation of the Object.assign pattern helps developers understand how configuration values are inherited and overridden.

4. **Better Component System Documentation**: Enhanced documentation clarifies the relationship between components and their configuration.

5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Overall cleaner code and clearer documentation makes the codebase easier to maintain.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Temporary Debug Code**: Debug logging should be viewed as temporary, with a plan to remove it after the feature is stable. This update completes the proper cleanup phase.

2. **Documentation for Patterns**: Even common patterns like Object.assign should be explicitly documented to ensure consistent understanding across the development team.

3. **Configuration Inheritance**: Clear documentation about how configuration inheritance works is essential for a component-based system.

4. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Excessive debug logging can hide important information. A clean console makes it easier to identify actual issues.

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the refactoring plan will proceed to:

1. **Phase 3**: Hardcoded Values Check - Review each component for hardcoded values that should be configurable.

2. **Phase 4**: Testing - Verify all components render correctly with the new changes.

3. **Phase 5**: Further Documentation - Enhance the refactoring pattern documentation for future reference.

By systematically addressing these issues, we continue to improve the component architecture, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.3.0_ComponentSingleSourceOfTruth =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.3.0 - Component Single Source of Truth Implementation

## Overview
This update implements Phase 1 of the CardFrame refactoring plan to establish a consistent "Single Source of Truth" principle across all components. The goal is to ensure each component is the definitive source for its domain-specific configuration, improving code maintainability and preventing configuration drift.

## Problem Analysis
The CardFrame system had been refactored into specialized components (Visual, Health, Content, Interaction), but configuration patterns were inconsistent, leading to:

1. **Confusion About Configuration Location**: Developers were uncertain where specific configuration properties should be defined.
2. **Configuration Duplication**: Some properties were redundantly defined in both CardFrameManager and component files.
3. **Inconsistent Warnings**: Warning comments in CardFrameManager varied in strength and clarity.
4. **Missing Architectural Guidance**: There was no clear documentation establishing each component as the single source of truth for its domain.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added Explicit SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH Documentation
Added comprehensive documentation headers to all component files:

**CardFrameVisualComponent.js**:
```javascript
/**
 * CardFrameVisualComponent.js
 * Handles the visual aspects of the card frame including frame, backdrop, and visual effects
 * Part of the component-based CardFrame refactoring project
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This component is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all visual styling,
 * dimensions, and effects. To modify ANY aspect of the card's visual appearance,
 * edit the configuration options in THIS file rather than in CardFrameManager.js.
 * 
 * CODE REVIEW GUIDELINE: Any PR that adds visual-related configuration to
 * CardFrameManager.js should be rejected. All such configuration belongs here.
 */
```

**CardFrameContentComponent.js**:
```javascript
/**
 * CardFrameContentComponent.js
 * Handles character sprite and nameplate rendering for CardFrame.
 * Part of the component-based CardFrame refactoring project.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This component is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all character content,
 * portrait window, and nameplate styling/behavior. To modify ANY aspect of these elements,
 * edit the configuration options in THIS file rather than in CardFrameManager.js.
 * 
 * CODE REVIEW GUIDELINE: Any PR that adds content-related configuration to
 * CardFrameManager.js should be rejected. All such configuration belongs here.
 */
```

**CardFrameInteractionComponent.js**:
```javascript
/**
 * CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
 * Handles interaction behavior for the CardFrame component

 */
```

### 2. Enhanced CardFrameManager Documentation
Added comprehensive architecture notes to CardFrameManager.js:

```javascript
/**
 * CardFrameManager.js
 * Manages a component-based implementation of the card frame system
 * Acts as a delegation layer to coordinate visual, health, content, and interaction components
 *
 * IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE NOTE: CardFrameManager serves as a coordinator/orchestrator
 * for specialized components. It should NOT define component-specific configuration.
 * Each component is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for its domain:
 *
 * - CardFrameVisualComponent: ALL visual styling, dimensions, and effects
 * - CardFrameHealthComponent: ALL health bar styling and behavior
 * - CardFrameContentComponent: ALL character content, portrait window, and nameplate styling
 * - CardFrameInteractionComponent: ALL interaction behaviors and animations
 *
 * CODE REVIEW GUIDELINE: Any PR that adds component-specific configuration to
 * CardFrameManager.js should be rejected. Such configuration belongs in the respective
 * component files.
 */
```

### 3. Strengthened Warning Messages
Enhanced all warning comments in CardFrameManager.js to be more explicit and consistent:

```javascript
// NOTE: ALL visual styling, dimensions, and effects properties
// should be configured ONLY in CardFrameVisualComponent.js.
// DO NOT add any visual styling/appearance properties here.
// This violates the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH principle.
```

```javascript
// NOTE: ALL content styling, portrait, and nameplate properties 
// should be configured ONLY in CardFrameContentComponent.js.
// DO NOT add any content-related properties here.
// This violates the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH principle.
```

```javascript
// NOTE: ALL interaction, hover, and animation properties
// should be configured ONLY in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js.
// DO NOT add any interaction-related properties here.
// This violates the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH principle.
```

### 4. Added Code Review Guidelines
Added explicit code review guidelines to all components as part of their documentation headers. These guidelines instruct reviewers to reject PRs that add component-specific configuration to CardFrameManager.

## Architectural Benefits

1. **Clear Configuration Boundaries**: Each component is now explicitly designated as the single source of truth for its domain.

2. **Developer Guidance**: Documentation clearly guides developers on where to place configuration values.

3. **Code Review Enforcement**: Added guidelines create a mechanism to enforce architectural boundaries during code review.

4. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Enhanced warning messages leave no doubt about where configuration belongs.

5. **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent documentation pattern makes the codebase more maintainable.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Document Architecture Decisions**: Clearly documenting architectural decisions like "single source of truth" in code comments helps maintain proper boundaries.

2. **Explicit Code Review Guidelines**: Adding explicit review guidelines in code helps enforce architectural principles over time.

3. **Strong Warning Messages**: Using stronger, more consistent warnings prevents configuration drift better than subtle hints.

4. **Progressive Implementation**: Breaking the refactoring into phases (of which this is Phase 1) helps manage complexity and risk.

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the CardFrame refactoring plan will proceed to:

1. **Phase 2**: Configuration Cleanup - Remove all debug logging from components (especially CardFrameVisualComponent) and remove commented properties from CardFrameManager.

2. **Phase 3**: Hardcoded Values Check - Review each component for hardcoded values that should be configurable.

3. **Phase 4**: Testing - Verify all components render correctly with the new changes.

4. **Phase 5**: Further Documentation - Enhance the refactoring pattern documentation for future reference.

By implementing this phased approach, we are systematically improving the component architecture to follow best practices, ensuring each component properly serves as the single source of truth for its domain.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.2.9_HealthComponentSingleSourceOfTruth =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.2.9 - Health Component Single Source of Truth

## Overview
This update corrects a key issue with the component-based architecture by properly establishing CardFrameHealthComponent as the single source of truth for all health bar styling, dimensions, and behavior. Previously, there was an incorrect configuration inheritance pattern that prevented CardFrameManager's values from properly overriding the component defaults, and a hardcoded font size was being used instead of the configured value.

## Problem Analysis

The analysis revealed several issues with the component configuration:

1. **Incorrect Object.assign Order**: 
   ```javascript
   this.config = Object.assign({}, config, ourDefaults);
   ```
   This meant that the component's defaults (`ourDefaults`) would override any values coming from CardFrameManager (`config`), which is backwards from proper component architecture. Components should define defaults that can be overridden by their parent/manager.

2. **Hardcoded Font Size**: 
   ```javascript
   fontSize: '11px', // Hardcoded value
   ```
   Despite having `healthTextFontSize` in the configuration, the text creation method was using a hardcoded value, ignoring any configured value.

3. **Leftover Commented Code**: CardFrameManager still contained commented-out health bar properties, creating confusion about where configuration should live.

4. **Insufficient Documentation**: The documentation didn't provide strong enough guidance about the single source of truth principle.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Fixed Configuration Hierarchy

Changed the Object.assign call to use the correct order:

```javascript
// Changed from:
this.config = Object.assign({}, config, ourDefaults);

// To:
this.config = Object.assign({}, ourDefaults, config);
```

This ensures that component defaults are only used when not specified by the parent component (CardFrameManager), following proper component architecture principles.

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Font Size

Updated the font size in text creation to use the configured value:

```javascript
// Changed from:
fontSize: '11px', // Hardcoded value

// To:
fontSize: this.config.healthTextFontSize,
```

This ensures that the font size can be properly configured and overridden when needed.

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

Added stronger documentation with more explicit guidance:

```javascript
/**
 * IMPORTANT: This component is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all health bar styling,
 * dimensions, and positioning. To modify ANY aspect of the health bar, edit the
 * configuration options in THIS file rather than in CardFrameManager.js.
 * 
 * CODE REVIEW GUIDELINE: Any PR that adds health-related configuration to
 * CardFrameManager.js should be rejected. All such configuration belongs here.
 */
```

### 4. Removed Commented-Out Properties

Completely removed all commented-out health bar properties from CardFrameManager and replaced with a clearer directive:

```javascript
// Changed from:
// healthBarWidth: 180,        // Width of health bar
// healthBarHeight: 20,        // Height of health bar
// healthBarOffsetY: -148,     // Distance from center to health bar
// showHealthText: true,       // Whether to show health text

// To:
// NOTE: ALL health bar styling, dimensions, and appearance properties
// should be configured ONLY in CardFrameHealthComponent.js.
// DO NOT add any health styling/dimensions properties here.
```

### 5. Added Warning Comments

Added warning comments in strategic locations to prevent future configuration drift:

```javascript
/**
 * Initialize the health component for health bar and health updates.
 * IMPORTANT: All health bar styling, dimensions, and behavior should be configured
 * in CardFrameHealthComponent.js, not here in CardFrameManager.js.
 */
```

## Benefits

1. **True Modularization**: CardFrameHealthComponent is now the definitive source of truth for all health-related functionality.

2. **Proper Configuration Inheritance**: Parent components can override defaults in child components as needed, following standard component patterns.

3. **Consistent Documentation**: Clear guidance across the codebase about where health-related configuration belongs.

4. **Future-Proofing**: Strategic warning comments and code review guidelines help prevent configuration drift in the future.

5. **Improved Font Size Control**: Font size is now properly controlled through configuration, making it easy to adjust.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration Inheritance Order Matters**: The order of parameters in Object.assign is critical - defaults should be first, followed by specific values that should override those defaults.

2. **Avoid Hardcoded Values**: Even during development, avoid hardcoding values that should be configurable, as they can easily be overlooked.

3. **Be Explicit About Architecture**: Clear documentation and code review guidelines are essential for maintaining architectural principles, especially in component-based systems.

4. **Complete Refactoring**: When moving functionality to a component, ensure ALL related code and configuration moves with it, including removing commented-out code from its original location.

5. **Single Source of Truth**: This principle should be explicitly documented and enforced through code organization and review procedures.

## Next Steps

With CardFrameHealthComponent properly established as the single source of truth for health bar styling, we can consider:

1. Applying the same pattern to ensure other components (Visual, Content, Interaction) properly follow the single source of truth principle.

2. Potentially adding gradient fills or other advanced visual enhancements to the health bar now that the configuration system is working properly.

3. Implementing automated tests to verify that configuration values are properly honored throughout the component hierarchy.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.2.8_HealthBarVisualEnhancements =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.2.8 - Health Bar Visual Enhancements

## Overview
This update focuses on improving the visual appearance of health bars in the CardFrame component. It adds rounded corners and beveled edges to create a more polished, dimensional look consistent with modern UI design practices. These enhancements make the health bars more visually appealing while maintaining their functionality.

## Problem Analysis

The original health bar implementation in CardFrameHealthComponent had several visual limitations:

1. **Flat Appearance**: The health bar used basic rectangles with sharp corners, giving it a flat, outdated look
2. **Lack of Dimensionality**: No visual cues provided depth or dimensionality to the UI element
3. **Sharp Corners**: The rectangular design with 90-degree corners felt rigid compared to modern UI standards
4. **Basic Implementation**: The code used simple Phaser Rectangle objects which limited styling options
5. **Animation Limitations**: The animation system was tied directly to Rectangle properties

These issues created a visual disconnect between the polished card frames and their relatively basic health bars, reducing the overall quality perception of the UI.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Enhanced Configuration
Added new configuration options to CardFrameHealthComponent:
```javascript
healthBarHeight: 14,            // Increased from 12px for better text visibility
healthBarBorderRadius: 4,       // Rounded corners for health bar
healthBarBevelWidth: 1,         // Width of the bevel effect
```

### 2. Graphics-Based Rendering
Replaced Rectangle objects with Phaser Graphics objects to allow for more complex styling:
```javascript
// Create health bar background with rounded corners
this.healthBarBg = this.scene.add.graphics();
this.healthBarBg.fillStyle(0x000000, 0.7);
this.healthBarBg.fillRoundedRect(
    -this.config.healthBarWidth / 2,
    -this.config.healthBarHeight / 2,
    this.config.healthBarWidth,
    this.config.healthBarHeight,
    radius
);
```

### 3. Beveled Edge Implementation
Added subtle 3D effect through lighter top/left edges and darker bottom/right edges:
```javascript
// Convert health color to RGB components
const colorObj = Phaser.Display.Color.ValueToColor(healthColor);
const darkerColor = Phaser.Display.Color.GetColor(
    Math.max(0, colorObj.r - 50),
    Math.max(0, colorObj.g - 50),
    Math.max(0, colorObj.b - 50)
);
const lighterColor = Phaser.Display.Color.GetColor(
    Math.min(255, colorObj.r + 50),
    Math.min(255, colorObj.g + 50),
    Math.min(255, colorObj.b + 50)
);
```

### 4. Improved Animation System
Implemented a more robust animation system that redraws graphics during transitions:
```javascript
// Create a tween on a dummy object to track progress
const dummyObj = { progress: 0 };
this.scene.tweens.add({
    targets: dummyObj,
    progress: 1,
    duration: this._healthAnimDuration,
    ease: 'Sine.easeOut',
    onUpdate: () => {
        // Calculate interpolated values
        const currentPercent = Phaser.Math.Linear(
            this._startHealthPercent,
            this._targetHealthPercent,
            dummyObj.progress
        );
        
        // Redraw health bar with current values
        this._updateHealthBarGraphics(currentPercent);
    }
});
```

## Technical Details

### Graphics Redraw Helper Method
Added a new `_updateHealthBarGraphics` method to handle redrawing during animation:
```javascript
_updateHealthBarGraphics(healthPercent) {
    // Clear existing graphics
    this.healthBar.clear();
    
    // Get configuration values
    const radius = this.config.healthBarBorderRadius || 3;
    // [...]
    
    // Fill the health bar with rounded corners
    this.healthBar.fillRoundedRect(
        -barWidth / 2,
        -barHeight / 2,
        adjustedWidth,
        barHeight,
        healthPercent < 0.1 ? radius / 2 : radius
    );
    
    // Update bevel graphics
    // [...]
}
```

### Smart Corner Handling
Implemented adaptive corner radii that account for health percentage:
- Uses reduced radii for very low health (< 10%) to prevent visual glitches
- Completely skips rounded corners when health is 0
- Properly handles the transition between states

### Color Calculation
Added dynamic color derivation for beveled edges:
- Calculates darker color (shadow) by reducing RGB values by 50
- Calculates lighter color (highlight) by increasing RGB values by 50
- Applies different opacity to each for subtle effect

### Element Naming
Applied proper element naming to facilitate updates during animation:
```javascript
// Create inner bevel with a name
const innerBevel = this.scene.add.graphics().setName('innerBevel');
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved Visual Quality**: The health bars now have a modern, polished appearance consistent with quality UI design
2. **Enhanced Depth Perception**: Beveled edges create a subtle 3D effect that makes elements appear more tactile
3. **Visual Harmony**: Rounded corners align with the card frame's overall design language
4. **Flexible Animation**: The new animation system supports complex transitions and effects
5. **Future Extensibility**: The graphics-based approach enables further visual enhancements in the future

## Performance Considerations

The implementation carefully balances visual quality with performance:
- Uses a single graphics object for the health bar fill to minimize draw calls
- Avoids excessive effects that would impact performance
- Properly cleans up and manages resources during animations
- Uses clipping to ensure efficient rendering

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to the health bar could include:
1. **Gradient Fill**: Add a subtle vertical gradient for additional dimensionality
2. **Pattern Overlay**: Implement a faint pattern overlay for added visual interest
3. **Custom Font Integration**: Replace Arial with a more thematic game font
4. **Type-Themed Styling**: Match health bar appearance to character type (water, fire, etc.)
5. **Particle Effects**: Add subtle particle effects on significant health changes

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these changes function correctly, test:
1. Health increases and decreases with different amounts
2. Different health percentages (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
3. Rapid successive health changes
4. Health transitions at very low percentages
5. Cards with varying types to ensure consistent appearance
