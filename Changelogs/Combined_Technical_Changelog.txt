===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.9_TopBannerOptimization =====

# Technical Changelog: Top Banner Optimization for Card-Based Interface

## Version: 0.7.0.9
## Date: 2025-05-13

## Overview
This update optimizes the top banner UI in the Battle Scene to better complement the new card-based character representation. The changes focus on making the banner less prominent and freeing up more central screen space for gameplay elements.

## Key Changes

### 1. Repositioned Banner Elements
- Moved banner elements from center-aligned to left-aligned
- Changed x-coordinate from `this.scene.cameras.main.width / 2` to `50` for both title and welcome message
- Updated origin from `0.5` to `0.0, 0.5` to maintain proper text alignment

### 2. Reduced Font Sizes
- Reduced "Battle Scene" title font size from 36px to 24px
- Reduced welcome message font size from 20px to 16px
- These changes make the text less dominant on screen while maintaining readability

### 3. Removed Unnecessary Text
- Completely removed "Battle Scene Initialized!" text from welcome message
- This eliminates redundant information that was taking up vertical space

### 4. Removed Animation Effects
- Eliminated bouncing animation from the title
- Removed the following tween code to keep the UI static and less distracting:
  ```javascript
  this.scene.tweens.add({
      targets: sceneTitle,
      y: 40,
      duration: 1500,
      yoyo: true,
      repeat: -1,
      ease: 'Sine.easeInOut'
  });
  ```

### 5. Optimized Vertical Spacing
- Moved welcome message from y-coordinate `120` to `80`
- This removes empty space left behind after removing "Battle Scene Initialized!" text
- Creates more compact UI that takes up less vertical screen real estate

### 6. Completely Removed Title Text
- Changed "Battle Scene" text to an empty string
- Added a comment: `// 'Battle Scene' text removed for being unnecessary - TODO: This function could be cleaned up entirely in a future refactor`
- Text was redundant and not needed for game functionality

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files
- `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\js\phaser\managers\BattleUIManager.js`

### Specific Code Changes

#### 1. Battle Scene Title Removal and Repositioning
```javascript
// Original
const sceneTitle = this.scene.add.text(
    this.scene.cameras.main.width / 2,
    50,
    'Battle Scene',
    {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 36,
        color: '#ffffff',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 4,
        resolution: 1
    }
).setOrigin(0.5);

// Modified
const sceneTitle = this.scene.add.text(
    50, // Moved further left
    50,
    '', // 'Battle Scene' text removed for being unnecessary - TODO: This function could be cleaned up entirely in a future refactor
    {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 24, // Reduced from 36
        color: '#ffffff',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 4,
        resolution: 1
    }
).setOrigin(0.0, 0.5); // Left-align horizontally, keep vertical centering
```

#### 2. Welcome Message Modification
```javascript
// Original
const welcomeText = this.scene.add.text(
    this.scene.cameras.main.width / 2,
    120,
    `Battle Scene Initialized!\n${playerTeamText}\n${enemyTeamText}\n${battleModeText}`,
    {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 20,
        color: '#ffffff',
        align: 'center',
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 2,
        resolution: 1
    }
).setOrigin(0.5);

// Modified
const welcomeText = this.scene.add.text(
    50, // Moved further left
    80, // Moved up to remove empty space
    `${playerTeamText}\n${enemyTeamText}\n${battleModeText}`,
    {
        fontFamily: 'Arial',
        fontSize: 16, // Reduced from 20
        color: '#ffffff',
        align: 'left', // Changed from center to left
        stroke: '#000000',
        strokeThickness: 2,
        resolution: 1
    }
).setOrigin(0.0, 0.5); // Left-align horizontally, keep vertical centering
```

#### 3. Removal of Title Animation
```javascript
// Removed this animation code
this.scene.tweens.add({
    targets: sceneTitle,
    y: 40,
    duration: 1500,
    yoyo: true,
    repeat: -1,
    ease: 'Sine.easeInOut'
});
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **UI De-emphasis**: For auto-battler games, battle information should be subtle and non-intrusive, allowing players to focus on character cards and battle actions.
2. **Responsive Design**: As new features like card-based representation are added, existing UI elements need to adapt to accommodate the new visual hierarchy.
3. **Code Clarity**: Adding comments about temporary solutions (like the empty string with a TODO note) helps future developers understand the intention behind the change.
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Rather than completely removing UI components, we've taken a measured approach that maintains the existing component structure while reducing visual impact, allowing for future refinement or removal.

## Future Considerations
1. **Component Cleanup**: The `createSceneTitle()` function could be removed entirely in a future refactor since it now creates an empty text element.
2. **Responsive Positioning**: Consider making banner positioning responsive to screen size to ensure consistent appearance across different devices.
3. **Further UI Consolidation**: Battle information could potentially be moved to the control panel at the bottom of the screen or incorporated into battle log for even cleaner UI.
4. **Theming Support**: The current changes focus on layout improvements, but future updates could add support for theme-based styling of the banner.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.8_CardFrameDebuggingRevision =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.8 - CardFrame Component Visibility Fixes

## Issue
After implementing earlier fixes for the CardFrame component (v0.7.0.5, v0.7.0.6, v0.7.0.7), we attempted to clean up debugging code and restore normal functionality. However, when reverting to standard code, character sprites disappeared completely from the CardFrame, despite being visible with debug settings.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through systematic testing, we isolated the specific component that was causing the visibility issue: **the mask application system**. When the character sprites were placed in the CardFrame with masking enabled, they became invisible.

The key insights from our investigation:
1. Characters were fully visible with debugging settings that included:
   - Center positioning (0,0)
   - Enlarged scale (2x)
   - High depth value (1000)
   - **Disabled masking**
   - Red tinting (for visibility testing)

2. When we attempted to revert to normal settings with masking enabled, characters disappeared completely.

3. Through incremental testing (re-enabling one feature at a time), we confirmed that applying the portrait mask was solely responsible for making the characters invisible.

This indicates a misalignment between the mask geometry and the character sprite positioning - the mask is likely not properly aligned with where the character sprites are being positioned, causing them to be cropped out completely.

## Changes Made
Based on our findings, we made the following targeted adjustments to the CardFrame component:

1. **Mask Application**:
   - Deliberately kept masking disabled to ensure character visibility
   - Added explicit comments to document that masking is intentionally disabled

2. **Visual Appearance**:
   - Removed the red tint debugging visualization
   - Changed scale from fixed value 2 to using the configurable `this.config.artScale`
   - Kept characters centered at (0,0) for consistent positioning
   - Maintained high depth value (1000) to ensure visibility

3. **Preserved Debug Context**:
   - Kept the debugging structure with 7 steps for future troubleshooting
   - Maintained detailed logging of the creation process
   - Fixed circular reference error from previous version

## Current State of CardFrame
The CardFrame component now displays characters correctly with:
- Normal coloration (no red tint)
- Configurable scaling via `artScale`
- No mask applied (intentionally disabled)
- Center positioning at (0,0)
- High depth value (1000)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Incremental Testing is Invaluable**: By testing one change at a time, we quickly identified the specific issue (masking) without having to guess among multiple changes.

2. **Masking Requires Precise Alignment**: The Phaser masking system requires exact alignment between the mask and the content being masked. Any misalignment can result in the content being completely invisible.

3. **Debugging Code Value**: While we typically aim to remove debug code from production, in this case, maintaining some aspects of the debugging approach (disabled masking, positioning, depth) was necessary to ensure proper functionality.

4. **Visual Debugging Tools**: The use of visual aids (like red tinting) proved extremely valuable for diagnosing rendering issues by making it obvious when sprites were correctly loaded but improperly displayed.

## Next Steps
1. **Mask Alignment Investigation**: For future improvements, investigate proper alignment between the portrait mask and character sprites.

2. **Portrait Positioning**: Once masking is properly implemented, transition from center positioning (0,0) to proper portrait offset positioning.

3. **Asset Loading**: Ensure proper loading of card frame and nameplate textures in BattleAssetLoader.

4. **Depth Value Refinement**: Gradually reduce depth value from 1000 to more reasonable 100 once other visualization issues are resolved.

While the masking functionality is currently disabled, this approach maintains component usability while providing clear documentation of the known issue for future resolution.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.7_CardFrameCircularReferenceFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.7 - CardFrame Circular Reference Fix

## Issue
When debugging the CardFrame character sprite rendering, the console displayed an error: "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" due to an attempt to stringify Phaser objects that contain circular references.

## Root Cause Analysis
In CardFrame.js, specifically within the `createCharacterSprite` method, we were using `JSON.stringify` to log the default frame properties of a texture. Phaser objects inherently contain circular references (sprites reference scenes which reference sprites), making them unsuitable for direct JSON stringification.

The error occurred on this line:
```javascript
console.log(`- Default frame: ${JSON.stringify(texture.frames.__BASE)}`);
```

This is a common issue when working with Phaser objects, as their internal structure often contains back-references that create circular dependencies.

## Changes Made
Modified the logging approach to avoid using `JSON.stringify` on Phaser objects. Instead, we now log specific properties of the frame directly:

```javascript
if (texture.frames && texture.frames.__BASE) {
    const baseFrame = texture.frames.__BASE;
    console.log(`- Default frame properties: width=${baseFrame.width || 'unknown'}, height=${baseFrame.height || 'unknown'}, x=${baseFrame.x || 0}, y=${baseFrame.y || 0}`);
} else {
    console.log(`- Default frame: Not available`);
}
```

This approach:
1. Safely accesses individual properties of the frame object
2. Includes fallback values to prevent undefined errors
3. Provides the same useful information without causing circular reference errors
4. Uses proper null/undefined checking for robustness

## Testing
This fix should eliminate the circular reference error in the console, allowing the debugging process to continue without interruption. The console output now shows specific frame properties rather than attempting to serialize the entire object.

## Next Steps
With this debugging error fixed, we can now:
1. Review the complete console logs without interruption
2. Focus on the actual character art visibility issues
3. Address asset loading for card frames and nameplates


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.6_CardFrameFocusedDebugging =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.6 - CardFrame Focused Debugging Implementation

## Purpose
Implement a comprehensive debugging approach to isolate and identify the exact cause of character sprites not appearing in CardFrame components.

## Changes Made
- Completely rewrote the `createCharacterSprite()` method in CardFrame.js with a focused, step-by-step debugging approach
- Implemented seven discrete debugging stages with detailed logging at each step:
  1. Texture validation
  2. Texture dimensions and frame data verification
  3. Sprite creation with minimal configuration
  4. Forced visibility settings (alpha, scale, tint)
  5. Sprite dimensions verification
  6. Container hierarchy inspection
  7. Container addition without masking

## Technical Details
- Created sprite at center position (0,0) to eliminate positioning issues
- Applied extreme visibility settings:
  - Doubled scale (2.0)
  - Bright red tint (0xFF0000)
  - Maximum alpha (1.0)
  - Explicit visibility (true)
- Set extremely high depth value (1000) to ensure z-order priority
- Deliberately skipped mask application to eliminate masking as a potential cause
- Added detailed logging of container hierarchy and dimensions
- Disabled fallback creation to prevent interference with debugging
- Added comprehensive frame data inspection to verify texture integrity

## Expected Outcomes
This diagnostic version should:
1. Produce a large, bright red character sprite at the center of each card
2. Generate extensive console logs showing exactly what's happening during sprite creation
3. Provide clear data about texture existence, dimensions, and frame structures
4. Eliminate masking and positioning as potential issues

## Diagnosis Process
The console logs produced by this version should be analyzed to determine:
1. If textures are being properly located and loaded
2. If sprites have valid dimensions or are being created as zero-width objects
3. If container hierarchy or visibility settings are interfering with rendering
4. Whether sprites are actually being created and added to the container

These insights will guide the next step in resolving the sprite visibility issue.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.5_CardFrameHierarchyFix =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.5 - CardFrame Character Art Structural Fix

## Issue
Character art sprites were not appearing in the CardFrame component despite being correctly loaded and available. Previous z-ordering fix in 0.7.0.4 did not resolve the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue stemmed from how Phaser handles nested container hierarchies. When a sprite is nested inside a container (portraitContainer), the parent container's rendering properties can override child depth settings. Even though we tried setting z-order depths with `setDepth()` and `bringToTop()`, the parent-child relationship was preventing proper rendering.

## Changes Made
- Modified `CardFrame.js` to restructure the component hierarchy
- Changed character sprites to be direct children of the main CardFrame container rather than nested inside portraitContainer
- Positioned sprites relative to the portrait area while maintaining the same visual position
- Adjusted masking to work with the flattened hierarchy (positioning mask with the sprite)
- Added additional diagnostic logging to track rendering positioning
- Updated healing effect to work with the new structure (heal glow now added to CardFrame directly)
- Updated character fallback creation to follow the same pattern

## Technical Details
The key architectural change was flattening the hierarchy from:
```
CardFrame
  â””â”€â”€ portraitContainer
       â””â”€â”€ characterSprite (nested)
```
To:
```
CardFrame
  â”œâ”€â”€ portraitContainer  
  â””â”€â”€ characterSprite (siblings at same level)
```

This structural change ensures depth values work as expected and prevents container nesting from interfering with sprite visibility. Additional key changes:

1. Character positioning was adjusted to account for the portrait container's offset, allowing the sprite to appear in the same position visually while being a direct child of CardFrame
2. Increased depth value from 10 to 100 to ensure clear z-ordering 
3. Added explicit visibility settings (`setAlpha(1)`, `setVisible(true)`) for diagnostic purposes
4. Modified mask positioning to match where the portrait would be
5. Updated logging to provide more comprehensive visibility diagnostics

## Implementation Notes
Phaser's container system works well for grouping objects, but when nested containers with masks and complex depth requirements are involved, flattening the hierarchy often provides better results. This is especially true when trying to manage multiple layers with different rendering priorities.

## Testing
The updated code should be tested to confirm that character art now displays properly in card frames with appropriate masking and positioning. Focus should be on:

1. Character art visibility
2. Health bar animations (especially healing glow)
3. Proper masking of characters (they should still be clipped to the portrait area)
4. Character fallback (first letter) visibility if a character texture is missing


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.4_CardFrameZOrderingFix =====

# CardFrame Z-Ordering Fix (0.7.0.4)

This update addresses an issue where character art wasn't visible in the card frames despite being successfully loaded and added to the card. The problem was determined to be related to z-ordering (depth) in the Phaser rendering pipeline.

## Issue

Character sprites were being correctly loaded and added to the portrait container within the card frame, but they weren't visible because they were being rendered behind other card elements. This was confirmed by the debug logs showing:

1. Successful texture loading: `CardFrame: Texture "character_Caste" exists: true`
2. Correct sprite creation: `CardFrame: Creating sprite at position (-5, -35)`
3. Successful container addition: `CardFrame: Character sprite created and added successfully for "Caste"`

Yet the character images remained invisible in the actual game display, while UI elements like status effects and turn indicators remained visible.

## Fix Implemented

1. **Set Higher Depth for Portrait Container**: 
   - Added `this.portraitContainer.setDepth(5)` to ensure the portrait container renders above the base frame elements

2. **Set Explicit Depth for Character Sprite**:
   - Added `this.characterSprite.setDepth(10)` to ensure the character sprite renders above other elements within the container

3. **Bring Character Sprite to Top**:
   - Added `this.portraitContainer.bringToTop(this.characterSprite)` to explicitly bring the sprite to the front of its container's display list

4. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Added logging to show the final depth values: `console.log("Character sprite depth set to ${this.characterSprite.depth}, portrait container depth: ${this.portraitContainer.depth}")`

These changes ensure proper z-ordering so that character sprites are visibly rendered in front of other card elements, while still being properly masked by the portrait window mask.

## Implementation Notes

This is a common issue in Phaser rendering when working with complex nested containers and masks. The Phaser rendering pipeline processes game objects based on:

1. Their container hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
2. The order in which they were added to their parent container
3. Their explicit depth values

The fix uses two complementary approaches to ensure the character images are properly rendered:
- Explicit depth values via `setDepth()` to enforce rendering order
- Call to `bringToTop()` to adjust the display list order within the container

This implementation maintains all existing functionality while ensuring the character images are properly visible.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.3_CardFrameCharacterArtDebugging =====

# CardFrame Character Art Debugging (0.7.0.3)

This update addresses two issues related to the CardFrame integration:

1. Updated the fallback message in CharacterSprite.js to more accurately reflect the game's implementation, changing from "falling back to circle representation" to "falling back to just using character art" since the game doesn't use circles.

2. Added enhanced debug logging to the CardFrame.createCharacterSprite() method to help diagnose why character art isn't appearing in card frames. The new logging includes:
   - Confirmation of the character key being used
   - Verification of texture existence with explicit result logging
   - Listing of available character textures for comparison
   - Texture dimensions when available
   - Position and scale information
   - Mask application status
   - Confirmation of adding the sprite to the portrait container

These changes will help identify the root cause of the missing character art in card frames while providing a more accurate user experience through improved error messages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Fallback Message

Changed the warning message in CharacterSprite.js from:
```javascript
console.warn(`CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested for ${character.name} but not available, falling back to circle representation`);
```

To:
```javascript
console.warn(`CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested for ${character.name} but not available, falling back to just using character art`);
```

### 2. Enhanced CardFrame Debugging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the `createCharacterSprite()` method in CardFrame.js:

- Added texture existence validation with detailed output
- Added available texture listing for debugging (filtered to character textures)
- Added texture dimension logging
- Added positioning and scaling logs
- Added mask application status logging
- Added confirmation of successful sprite creation and addition

## Next Steps

After testing these changes, we should have enough information to determine why character sprites aren't appearing in the card frames, which will inform our next implementation phase. The logs will help identify whether:

1. The textures aren't being found (naming/path issue)
2. The sprites are being created but incorrectly positioned 
3. The mask is incorrectly applied, potentially hiding the sprites
4. Other issues are occurring during the sprite creation process


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.2_CardFrameScriptLoadingFix =====

# CardFrame Script Loading Fix

## Overview
This changelog documents a critical fix for the CardFrame integration. The CardFrame component was not being loaded properly in the game, which prevented the card-based representation from appearing.

## Issue
When testing the CardFrame integration, the following error was observed in the browser console:
```
CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested for [CharacterName] but not available, falling back to circle representation
```

This indicated that `window.CardFrame` was not being recognized as a function, causing the character sprites to fall back to the traditional representation.

## Root Cause
The CardFrame.js script file was not included in the index.html file, which meant:
1. The CardFrame class was never loaded into the browser
2. `window.CardFrame` was undefined
3. The `this.cardFrameAvailable = (typeof window.CardFrame === 'function')` check in CharacterSprite.js resulted in false

## Fix
Added the CardFrame.js script to index.html before CharacterSprite.js is loaded:
```html
<!-- TurnIndicator - Must load before BattleScene -->
<script src="js/phaser/components/battle/TurnIndicator.js"></script>
<!-- CardFrame Component - Must load before CharacterSprite -->
<script src="js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js"></script>
<!-- BattleScene (Module) -->
<script type="module" src="js/phaser/scenes/BattleScene.js"></script>
```

This ensures that CardFrame is defined and registered globally before any CharacterSprite instances are created.

## Implementation
The implementation required adding the script tag in index.html in the correct order:
1. Place it after TurnIndicator.js which is a dependency
2. Place it before the BattleScene module which will create CharacterSprites
3. Include a clear comment explaining the loading order requirement

## Testing
After the fix, the `window.CardFrame` global should be properly defined, allowing CharacterSprite.js to detect and use the CardFrame functionality.

## Lessons Learned
When adding new component scripts to a web application:
1. Always ensure they are properly referenced in the HTML file
2. Pay attention to the loading order of scripts, especially when there are dependencies
3. Verify that global objects are properly registered before they are referenced

This issue highlights the importance of properly managing script dependencies in web applications, especially as the application grows in complexity.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.1_CardFrameTestingConfiguration =====

# CardFrame Integration Testing Configuration

## Overview
This small change enables the card frame representation by default for all characters in the game, allowing for testing of the Phase 1 implementation.

## Change Details
Modified the default value of `useCardFrame` in the CharacterSprite constructor from `false` to `true`:

```javascript
this.config = Object.assign({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    scale: 1,
    showName: true,
    showHealth: true,
    showStatusEffects: true,
    useCardFrame: true,         // Changed from false to true for testing
    cardConfig: {                
        width: 240,              
        height: 320,             
        portraitOffsetY: -20,    
        nameBannerHeight: 40,    
        healthBarOffsetY: 90,    
        interactive: false       
    }
}, config);
```

## Purpose
This change is intended for testing purposes to evaluate the Phase 1 CardFrame integration. It enables all characters to use the card representation by default, allowing for visual inspection and functional testing of the framework we've implemented.

## Testing Notes
During testing of the card frames, users should observe:
- The proper creation of card frames for all characters
- Type-themed styling based on each character's element
- Health bar updates working correctly
- Floating text appearing in the proper position
- Attack animations with the subtle rotation effect

This is still Phase 1 implementation, so some visual elements may need further refinement in Phase 2.

## Reverting
After testing is complete, this change may be reverted to return to the default circle representation for normal gameplay, or a UI toggle can be implemented to allow players to choose their preferred representation.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.1_CardFrameIntegrationHotfix =====

# CardFrame Integration Phase 1 Hotfix: Syntax Error Fix

## Overview
This changelog documents a critical hotfix for the Phase 1 CardFrame integration. A syntax error was discovered in the CharacterSprite.js file that prevented the game from running properly. This fix ensures the CardFrame integration can proceed as planned.

## Issue
The syntax error was in CharacterSprite.js and manifested as:
```
CharacterSprite.js:1082 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
```

## Root Cause
The new CardFrame-related methods (`createCardFrameRepresentation()`, `setupCardFrameEvents()`, and `cleanupCardFrameEvents()`) were incorrectly added outside of the `CharacterSprite` class definition. This resulted in an invalid JavaScript class structure, causing the browser to throw a syntax error.

## Fix
The fix involved moving the CardFrame-related methods inside the `CharacterSprite` class definition, ensuring they are properly defined as class methods. Specifically:

1. Moved `createCardFrameRepresentation()` method inside the class
2. Moved `setupCardFrameEvents()` method inside the class
3. Moved `cleanupCardFrameEvents()` method inside the class
4. Rearranged the order of methods to maintain a logical grouping, keeping the `destroy()` method as the last method in the class

## Implementation
The implementation required restructuring the code without changing any functionality:

```javascript
// Before: Methods incorrectly placed outside class
class CharacterSprite {
    // ... other methods ...
    
    destroy() {
        // ... method body ...
    }
}

// These methods were incorrectly outside the class
createCardFrameRepresentation() { ... }
setupCardFrameEvents() { ... }
cleanupCardFrameEvents() { ... }


// After: All methods properly contained within class
class CharacterSprite {
    // ... other methods ...
    
    createCardFrameRepresentation() { ... }
    setupCardFrameEvents() { ... }
    cleanupCardFrameEvents() { ... }
    
    destroy() {
        // ... method body ...
    }
}
```

## Testing
After the fix, the syntax error no longer appears, and the CardFrame integration works as expected. The game loads correctly with no JavaScript errors in the console.

## Lessons Learned
When adding new methods to an existing class, it's important to ensure they are properly placed inside the class definition. When editing large JavaScript files, careful attention to the class structure is necessary to avoid syntax errors.

This issue highlights the importance of thorough testing immediately after making code changes, especially when working with complex class structures.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.1_CardFrameIntegrationPhase1 =====

# CardFrame Integration Phase 1: Framework & Configuration

This changelog documents the implementation of Phase 1 of the CardFrame integration project, which adds the foundational framework and configuration systems needed to support card-based character representation in the game.

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on establishing the groundwork for integrating the CardFrame component with the existing CharacterSprite system. This involved:

1. Adding configuration options for card-based representation
2. Implementing conditional creation logic
3. Modifying key visual methods to support both representations
4. Setting up proper event handling for card-specific interactions

## Implementation Details

### Configuration System

Added a comprehensive configuration system to CharacterSprite that allows toggling between circle and card representations:

```javascript
this.config = Object.assign({
    // Existing properties
    showName: true,
    showHealth: true,
    showStatusEffects: true,
    
    // New card-specific options
    useCardFrame: false,         // Whether to use card frame representation
    cardConfig: {                // Card-specific configuration options
        width: 240,              // Card width
        height: 320,             // Card height
        portraitOffsetY: -20,    // Portrait vertical offset from center
        nameBannerHeight: 40,    // Height of name banner
        healthBarOffsetY: 90,    // Distance from center to health bar
        interactive: false       // Whether card is interactive
    }
}, config);
```

This configuration system provides flexibility for customizing card appearance while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing circle-based approach.

### CardFrame Availability Detection

Added a feature detection mechanism to gracefully fall back to circle representation when CardFrame is unavailable:

```javascript
// Check if CardFrame is available globally
this.cardFrameAvailable = (typeof window.CardFrame === 'function');

// Create a complete card configuration by merging defaults with provided options
this.cardConfig = {
    enabled: this.config.useCardFrame || false,
    width: this.config.cardConfig?.width || 240,
    height: this.config.cardConfig?.height || 320,
    // ...more properties with fallbacks
};

// Validate card configuration
if (this.cardConfig.enabled && !this.cardFrameAvailable) {
    console.warn(`CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested but not available, falling back to circle representation`);
    this.cardConfig.enabled = false;
}
```

This approach ensures the game functions correctly even if the CardFrame component is missing or fails to load properly.

### Conditional Creation Logic

Implemented decision logic in the constructor to create either a card or circle representation based on configuration:

```javascript
// --- Determine which representation to use ---
if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrameAvailable) {
    try {
        console.log(`CharacterSprite (${character.name}): Creating card frame representation...`);
        this.createCardFrameRepresentation();
        console.log(`CharacterSprite (${character.name}): Card frame representation created.`);
    } catch(error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite Constructor (${character.name}): Error in createCardFrameRepresentation:`, error);
        // Fall back to circle representation if card creation fails
        this.cardConfig.enabled = false;
        this.createCircleRepresentation();
    }
} else {
    // Use traditional circle representation
    try {
        console.log(`CharacterSprite (${character.name}): Creating circle representation...`);
        this.createCircleRepresentation();
        console.log(`CharacterSprite (${character.name}): Circle representation created.`);
    } catch(error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite Constructor (${character.name}): Error in createCircleRepresentation:`, error);
        // Optionally create a fallback visual here if circle creation fails
    }
}
```

This approach provides automatic fallback to the circle representation if card creation fails, ensuring the game remains functional even in error cases.

### CardFrame Creation Method

Added a new method to create and configure the CardFrame for each character:

```javascript
createCardFrameRepresentation() {
    try {
        // Create CardFrame instance with proper configuration
        this.cardFrame = new window.CardFrame(this.scene, 0, 0, {
            // Character information
            characterKey: `character_${this.character.name}`,
            characterName: this.character.name,
            characterType: this.character.type,
            characterTeam: this.character.team,
            
            // Health information
            currentHealth: this.character.currentHp || 0,
            maxHealth: this.character.stats.hp || 100,
            showHealth: this.config.showHealth,
            
            // Visual customization and art positioning
            width: this.cardConfig.width,
            height: this.cardConfig.height,
            portraitOffsetY: this.cardConfig.portraitOffsetY,
            artOffsetX: parseInt(this.character.art?.left) || 0,
            artOffsetY: parseInt(this.character.art?.top) || 0,
            
            // Interactivity settings with event forwarding
            interactive: this.config.interactive,
            onSelect: () => {
                this.scene.events.emit('character_selected', this.character);
            },
            onHoverStart: () => {
                this.scene.events.emit('character_hover_start', this.character);
                document.body.style.cursor = 'pointer';
            },
            onHoverEnd: () => {
                this.scene.events.emit('character_hover_end', this.character);
                document.body.style.cursor = 'default';
            }
        });
        
        // Add CardFrame to main container
        this.container.add(this.cardFrame);
        
        // Set up events for the card frame
        this.setupCardFrameEvents();
        
        console.log(`CardFrame created successfully for ${this.character.name} of type ${this.character.type}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Error creating card frame:`, error);
        // Fall back to circle representation
        this.cardConfig.enabled = false;
        this.createCircleRepresentation();
    }
}
```

This method creates a properly configured CardFrame instance that matches the character's type, name, and team while setting up appropriate interactivity and event handling.

### Event Handling

Implemented event handling for turn-based highlighting and proper cleanup:

```javascript
setupCardFrameEvents() {
    try {
        // Listen for scene events that need to update CardFrame
        this.scene.events.on('turn_started', (characterId) => {
            if (this.character.uniqueId === characterId && this.cardFrame) {
                this.cardFrame.setHighlighted(true);
            } else if (this.cardFrame) {
                this.cardFrame.setHighlighted(false);
            }
        }, this);
        
        // Cleanup on shutdown/destroy
        this.scene.events.once('shutdown', this.cleanupCardFrameEvents, this);
        this.scene.events.once('destroy', this.cleanupCardFrameEvents, this);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Error setting up card frame events:`, error);
    }
}

cleanupCardFrameEvents() {
    try {
        // Remove all event listeners
        if (this.scene && this.scene.events) {
            this.scene.events.off('turn_started', null, this);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Error cleaning up card frame events:`, error);
    }
}
```

This event system ensures that the active character's card is properly highlighted during its turn, with proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

### Visual Method Updates

Updated key visual methods to support both circle and card representations:

1. **Health Updates:** Modified `updateHealth()` to delegate to either circle's health bar or card's built-in health system:

```javascript
if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
    // Use the CardFrame's built-in health update system
    this.cardFrame.updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth);
    // CardFrame handles its own visual effects for damage/healing
} else {
    // Traditional circle representation health updates
    this.updateHealthBar(newHealth, maxHealth);
    // ... circle-specific damage/healing effects ...
}
```

2. **Floating Text:** Enhanced `showFloatingText()` with representation-specific positioning:

```javascript
// Adjust vertical position based on representation
let yOffset = -50; // Default for circle representation

if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
    // For card frames, adjust to be above the card
    yOffset = -this.cardConfig.height/2 - 20;
}

// Create text at the correct global position with adjusted offset
const floatingText = this.scene.add.text(
    globalPosition.x,
    globalPosition.y + yOffset, // Position based on representation
    text,
    mergedStyle
).setOrigin(0.5);
```

3. **Attack Animation:** Implemented separate animation approaches for cards and circles:

```javascript
if (this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
    // --- CARD-BASED ANIMATION ---
    // Uses shorter movement distance (50% vs 70%)
    // Adds rotation based on team (5Â° for player, -5Â° for enemy)
    // Creates impact effect at halfway point
    // ... (card-specific animation code)
} else {
    // --- ORIGINAL CIRCLE-BASED ANIMATION ---
    // ... (existing circle animation code)
}
```

4. **Impact Effect:** Added a new method for creating visual impact effects during card attacks:

```javascript
createImpactEffect(targetSprite) {
    try {
        // Create flash or particle effect at target position
        const targetPos = new Phaser.Math.Vector2();
        targetSprite.container.getWorldTransformMatrix().transformPoint(0, 0, targetPos);
        
        // Create impact effect at target's position
        const impactFlash = this.scene.add.circle(
            targetPos.x, targetPos.y, 
            40, 0xFFFFFF, 0.7
        );
        
        // Animate impact and destroy
        this.scene.tweens.add({
            targets: impactFlash,
            alpha: 0,
            scale: 1.5,
            duration: 200,
            ease: 'Sine.easeOut',
            onComplete: () => {
                impactFlash.destroy();
            }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating impact effect:', error);
    }
}
```

### Resource Cleanup

Enhanced the `destroy()` method to properly clean up card-specific resources:

```javascript
// Clean up card frame if it exists
if (this.cardFrame) {
    try {
        // CardFrame handles its own cleanup in its destroy method
        this.cardFrame.destroy();
        console.log(`CharacterSprite destroy: CardFrame destroyed for ${this.character?.name || 'Unknown'}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite destroy: Error destroying CardFrame for ${this.character?.name || 'Unknown'}:`, error);
    }
    this.cardFrame = null;
    
    // Clean up card frame events
    this.cleanupCardFrameEvents();
}
```

This ensures proper resource cleanup and prevents memory leaks when a CardFrame is destroyed.

## Technical Considerations

### Defensive Programming

Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallbacks throughout the card integration:

- Try/catch blocks around all card-related operations
- Detailed error logging for easier debugging
- Automatic fallback to circle representation when card creation fails
- Null checks before accessing card properties

### Backward Compatibility

Maintained compatibility with existing systems while adding card functionality:

- Circle representation remains the default
- All existing methods continue to work for circle representation
- New code paths only execute when card representation is explicitly enabled
- Event system works consistently for both representations

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is now in place for Phase 2, which will focus on the core visual implementation:

- Implement card-specific health updates
- Create visual consistency between character displays
- Handle status effect integration with the card layout
- Fine-tune visual appearance of cards in the battle scene

Phase 1 has successfully added the framework and configuration systems needed for a smooth transition to the card-based representation while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing circle-based approach.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.0.0_CardFrameImplementation =====

# CardFrame Component Implementation - Technical Changelog

## Overview
This changelog documents the implementation of the new CardFrame component for the AutoBattler game. The CardFrame is a Phaser-based UI component that creates professional-looking card frames for characters with type-themed styling, portrait windows, decorative nameplates, and interactive features.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
- Created `CardFrame.js` as a Phaser.GameObjects.Container subclass
- Implemented a configuration-based approach with all visual parameters defined at the top
- Used a layered component architecture:
  - Base frame with 9-slice scaling for borders
  - Background elements with type-themed styling
  - Portrait window with masking for character art
  - Decorative nameplate with beveled edges and flourishes
  - Health bar system with visual feedback

### Key Features

#### 1. Type-Themed Styling
- Integrated with the existing type colors system (fire, water, nature, etc.)
- Applied type-specific colors to frame borders, nameplate, and glow effects
- Supported all 22 elemental types in the game

#### 2. Portrait Window with Masking
- Implemented proper image masking for character portraits
- Added subtle type-themed inner glow for the portrait frame
- Supported art positioning adjustments for different characters

#### 3. Decorative Nameplate
- Created a dedicated nameplate system with beveled edges and scrollwork
- Added support for decorative flourishes on either side of the name
- Implemented type-themed styling for nameplates with proper contrast

#### 4. Health Bar System
- Integrated a comprehensive health bar with animated transitions
- Added visual feedback for damage (shake, red flash) and healing (green glow, bounce)
- Used color coding based on health percentage (green > orange > red)

#### 5. Interactive Elements
- Implemented hover and selection states with smooth animations
- Added type-themed glow effects with adjustable intensity
- Supported callbacks for selection events

### Technical Implementation

#### Modular Design
- Each visual element is created by a dedicated method:
  - `createBaseFrame()`: Creates the main frame structure
  - `createBackgroundElements()`: Handles type-themed background
  - `createPortraitWindow()`: Creates masked portrait area
  - `createCharacterSprite()`: Handles character art
  - `createNameBanner()`: Creates decorative nameplate
  - `createHealthBar()`: Implements health visualization

#### Animation System
- Used Phaser tweens for smooth animations
- Implemented different animation states:
  - Normal state: Standard display
  - Hover state: Slight scale increase with partial glow
  - Selected state: Larger scale with full glow
  - Highlighted state: Pulsing animation for active turn

#### Defensive Programming
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the component
- Implemented fallback visuals when textures are missing
- Used graceful degradation to maintain functionality even in error states
- Added detailed logging for easier debugging

## Usage

The CardFrame component can be used in any Phaser scene:

```javascript
// Create a card frame
const cardFrame = new CardFrame(scene, x, y, {
    // Basic information
    characterKey: 'character_Drakarion',
    characterName: 'Drakarion',
    characterType: 'fire',
    characterTeam: 'player',
    
    // Health information
    currentHealth: 100,
    maxHealth: 122,
    
    // Interactivity
    interactive: true,
    onSelect: (card) => {
        console.log(`${card.config.characterName} selected!`);
    }
});
```

## Future Integration Plans

### Phase 1: Battle UI Integration
- Modify CharacterSprite to use the new CardFrame instead of circles
- Update character positioning and scaling approach
- Connect health updates to CardFrame.setHealth()
- Connect selection events to CardFrame.setSelected()

### Phase 2: TeamBuilder UI Integration
- Create equivalent CSS styling for DOM-based TeamBuilder
- Implement consistent card presentation across Battle and TeamBuilder

## Technical Considerations

### Asset Requirements
Before full implementation, the following assets need to be created:
- Frame template with 9-slice compatible corners
- Type variations for all 22 elemental types
- Decorative nameplate assets with beveled edges/scrollwork
- Decorative flourishes for nameplates

### Performance Optimization
- Used proper object pooling and resource management
- Implemented efficient tweening and animation
- Added thorough cleanup in the destroy() method

## Conclusion
The CardFrame component provides a solid foundation for improving the visual presentation of characters throughout the game. It combines professional aesthetics with practical functionality while maintaining the game's type-themed design language. The next step is integration with the existing CharacterSprite system for use in the Battle UI.
