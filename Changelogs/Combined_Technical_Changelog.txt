# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.13 - Fix BattleEventManager Registration Timing

## Overview
This update fixes a timing issue where the BattleUIManager was attempting to register the battle log with the BattleEventManager before the event manager had been initialized, resulting in a warning message:

```
[BattleUIManager] BattleEventManager not available or missing setBattleLog method
```

While this warning was harmless (the battle log continued to function via the BattleBridge), it indicated an architectural timing issue that needed to be resolved.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the initialization order in BattleScene:

1. `initializeUIManager()` was called first
   - This created the battle log via `createBattleLogPanel()`
   - `createBattleLogPanel()` immediately tried to register the battle log with `this.scene.eventManager`
   - But `this.scene.eventManager` didn't exist yet

2. `initializeBattleBridge()` was called later
   - This then called `initializeEventManager()` 
   - Only then was `this.eventManager` created

This created a timing dependency where one component tried to use another before it was available.

### Why the Battle Log Still Worked
The battle log continued to function normally because it connects to the battle events through the BattleBridge system, not just through the EventManager registration. The registration is an optimization that allows the EventManager to forward events directly to the battle log, but the log has its own event listeners as a fallback.

## Implementation Solution

### Approach: Scene as Dependency Mediator
Rather than having components try to directly interact with each other during initialization, the solution makes the BattleScene act as a mediator for cross-component dependencies. This follows the pattern already established for other components like TeamManager and FXManager.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Direct Registration from BattleUIManager
**File**: `js/phaser/managers/BattleUIManager.js`

Removed the problematic registration attempt in `createBattleLogPanel()`:
```javascript
// REMOVED:
// Register the battle log with the event manager if available
if (this.scene.eventManager && typeof this.scene.eventManager.setBattleLog === 'function') {
    this.scene.eventManager.setBattleLog(battleLog);
    console.log("[BattleUIManager] Registered battle log with BattleEventManager");
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleUIManager] BattleEventManager not available or missing setBattleLog method");
}

// REPLACED WITH:
// Store battle log reference in scene for later registration with EventManager
// The scene will handle registering it with the EventManager when available
```

The BattleUIManager now focuses solely on creating the battle log and storing the reference in the scene (`this.scene.battleLog = battleLog`).

#### 2. Added Scene-Mediated Registration
**File**: `js/phaser/scenes/BattleScene.js`

Added registration logic in `initializeEventManager()`:
```javascript
// Register battle log with EventManager if it exists
if (this.battleLog && typeof this.eventManager.setBattleLog === 'function') {
    this.eventManager.setBattleLog(this.battleLog);
    console.log('[BattleScene] Registered battle log with BattleEventManager');
}
```

This ensures the registration happens after both the battle log and event manager exist.

## Architectural Benefits

### 1. Eliminated Timing Dependencies
Components no longer need to worry about initialization order. Each focuses on its own responsibilities without needing to know when other components become available.

### 2. Consistent Pattern
This solution follows the existing pattern where BattleScene coordinates cross-component relationships:
- `eventManager.setTeamManager(this.teamManager)`
- `eventManager.setFXManager(this.fxManager)`
- Now also: `eventManager.setBattleLog(this.battleLog)`

### 3. Single Source of Truth
BattleScene acts as the orchestrator that knows when all components are available and can wire them together appropriately.

### 4. Improved Error Handling
No more spurious warning messages during normal initialization.

### 5. Future-Proof
This pattern makes it easy to add more cross-component dependencies without worrying about initialization order.

## Testing Verification

After implementing these changes:
1. The warning message should no longer appear during battle scene initialization
2. Battle log functionality should remain unchanged (continues to receive and display all battle events)
3. EventManager should properly receive the battle log reference for optimized event forwarding
4. Console should show: `[BattleScene] Registered battle log with BattleEventManager`

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Component Initialization Order Matters
When components depend on each other, careful consideration of initialization order is crucial. However, the better solution is often to remove the dependency rather than rely on specific ordering.

### 2. Scene as Mediator Pattern
Using the scene as a mediator for cross-component dependencies is more robust than having components directly interact during initialization.

### 3. Defensive Programming
Components should handle cases where dependencies aren't available yet, rather than assuming they will be.

### 4. Clear Separation of Concerns
Each component should focus on its primary responsibility. Cross-component wiring is better handled at a higher level (the scene).

## Future Considerations

This pattern could be extended to other cross-component dependencies in the game. Any time one component needs a reference to another, consider whether the scene should mediate that relationship rather than having direct coupling.

The fix maintains all existing functionality while eliminating the architectural timing issue, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.12_UILayoutAdjustments =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.12 - UI Layout Adjustments

## Overview
This update makes two small but impactful improvements to the game's UI layout:

1. Reduced the Battle Controls panel width to properly account for the removed Copy button
2. Repositioned the Battle Log control buttons (Pause and Copy) further to the right for better alignment

These changes follow up on the previous update (0.7.5.11) which relocated the Copy button from the Battle Controls panel to the Battle Log. After observing the UI in action, these refinements were needed to create a more balanced and visually pleasing layout.

## Problem Analysis

### Battle Controls Panel Size
The Battle Controls panel width calculation was updated in version 0.7.5.11 to remove space for the Copy button. However, the width calculation still accounted for 5 buttons instead of the actual 4 buttons now present (1 Start/Pause button and 3 speed buttons). This resulted in unnecessary empty space in the panel.

### Battle Log Control Buttons Position
The newly added Pause and Copy buttons above the Battle Log were positioned near the right edge, but not far enough to create a balanced appearance. The buttons needed to be moved further to the right to better align with the right edge of the Battle Log frame.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Fixed Battle Controls Panel Width Calculation
Updated the width calculation in the `createPanel()` method of BattleControlPanel.js:

```javascript
// Original code (incorrect)
// Width calculation updated: removed space for copy button (5 buttons instead of 6)
const width = (buttonWidth * 5) + (buttonSpacing * 6) + (this.config.padding * 2);

// Updated code (correct)
// Width calculation updated: properly accounts for 4 buttons (1 start/pause + 3 speed buttons)
const width = (buttonWidth * 4) + (buttonSpacing * 5) + (this.config.padding * 2);
```

This change ensures the panel width properly accounts for exactly the number of buttons present, creating a more compact and visually balanced control panel.

### 2. Repositioned Battle Log Control Buttons
Modified the positioning of both the Pause and Copy buttons in DirectBattleLog.js:

For the Pause button:
```javascript
// Original position
toggleContainer.x = this.width / 2 - buttonSize - 15; // Positioned at right edge with space for copy button

// New position
toggleContainer.x = this.width / 2 - 5; // Positioned close to right edge with spacing for copy button
```

For the Copy button:
```javascript
// Original position
copyContainer.x = this.width / 2 - 10; // Positioned at right edge

// New position
copyContainer.x = this.width / 2 + 25; // Positioned at far right edge
```

These position adjustments move both buttons further to the right while maintaining their relative spacing. The pause button is now positioned near the right edge, and the copy button is at the far right edge of the Battle Log frame.

## Architectural Benefits

### 1. Improved Visual Balance
The smaller Battle Controls panel now matches its actual content, eliminating unnecessary empty space. This creates a more balanced UI component that focuses on its core functionality.

### 2. Enhanced Control Proximity
By positioning the Battle Log controls further to the right, they better align with the right edge of the Battle Log frame, reinforcing the principle of control proximity established in version 0.7.5.11.

### 3. Consistent Spacing
The updated positioning maintains consistent spacing between the buttons while creating better overall alignment with the Battle Log's visual frame.

## Testing Process
The implementation was tested with specific focus on:
1. Visual verification of the Battle Controls panel width reduction
2. Confirmation that all buttons remain fully accessible and visually distinct
3. Verification of proper alignment of Battle Log control buttons with the frame
4. Testing interaction with all buttons to ensure functionality was maintained

## Lessons Learned
1. **UI Refinement Process**: Even after major UI changes, small refinements are often needed to perfect the visual balance.
2. **Accurate Component Sizing**: Component dimensions should exactly match their content requirements without unnecessary padding or space.
3. **Visual Alignment**: Proper alignment of controls with their parent containers reinforces the relationship between controls and the elements they affect.

## Next Steps
These UI refinements complete the Battle Log UI improvement project started in version 0.7.5.11. Future UI enhancements could include:
1. Further consistency improvements across all UI components
2. Additional visual feedback for button interactions
3. Keyboard shortcuts for common controls


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.11_BattleLogUIImprovement =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.11 - Battle Log UI Improvement

## Overview
This update improves the user experience by reorganizing UI controls related to the battle log, following the principle of control proximity - placing UI controls near the elements they affect. The two main issues addressed were:

1. The pause button being inside the battle log's card frame, creating visual clutter and inconsistency.
2. The "Copy Battle Log" button being in the Battle Controls panel at the bottom of the screen, far from the actual battle log it affects.

## Problem Analysis
### Poor Control Placement
The original implementation positioned the pause button inside the battle log frame. This created several issues:
- It cluttered the visual appearance of the card-style battle log
- It was inconsistent with the card design pattern used throughout the game
- It made the controls less prominent and harder to identify

### Disconnected Functionality
The "Copy Battle Log" button was located in the BattleControlPanel at the bottom of the screen, disconnected from the battle log itself. This created a poor mental model for users:
- Users had to look in unexpected places for related functionality
- The spatial disconnect made the UI less intuitive
- It violated the component responsibility principle, where each UI component should manage its own controls

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Created Control Buttons Container
Added a dedicated container positioned above the battle log card frame:
```javascript
// Create container for control buttons positioned above the battle log frame
this.controlButtonsContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, -30); // Position above frame
this.container.add(this.controlButtonsContainer); // Add to container property
```

### 2. Redesigned Pause Button
Completely redesigned the pause button with proper styling and interactions:
- Changed from a simple text element to a properly styled button with background
- Improved visual feedback with hover and press effects
- Added tooltips for better user experience
- Positioned it in the new control buttons container

### 3. Added Copy Button
Implemented a new copy button with matching styling:
```javascript
addCopyButton() {
    // Create styled button with rounded rectangle background
    // Add clipboard icon and proper interaction effects
    // Position next to pause button in control container
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Copy Functionality
Moved all copy-related functionality from BattleControlPanel to DirectBattleLog:
- `copyBattleLog()` - Formats and copies log content
- `copyToClipboard()` - Handles clipboard API
- `fallbackCopy()` - Fallback for browsers without clipboard API
- `showCopyFeedback()` - Shows success/failure message

### 5. Updated Message Rendering Process
Modified the `renderMessages()` method to properly handle the control buttons container during updates:
```javascript
// Store control buttons container to preserve it
const controlButtons = this.controlButtonsContainer;
const pauseState = this.messageProcessingPaused;

// Temporarily remove control buttons container from main container
if (controlButtons) {
    this.container.remove(controlButtons, false); // false = don't destroy
}

// ... recreate frame elements ...

// Re-add control buttons container if it existed
if (controlButtons && !controlButtons.destroyed) {
    this.controlButtonsContainer = controlButtons;
    this.container.add(this.controlButtonsContainer);
} else {
    // If container was somehow destroyed, recreate it
    // ...
}
```

### 6. Removed Code from BattleControlPanel
Modified BattleControlPanel to remove:
- Copy button creation code
- Vertical divider that separated the copy button
- Copy-related methods
- Updated width calculation to account for removed button

## Implementation Challenges

### Container Hierarchy Management
The main challenge was ensuring the control buttons container was properly preserved during message rendering. The rendering process needed to:
1. Temporarily remove the control buttons container
2. Clear the main container (which would destroy all child objects)
3. Recreate the frame elements
4. Re-add the control buttons container

This required careful management of container references and proper use of the `remove()` method's second parameter to prevent destroying the container.

### Handling Render Errors
We implemented comprehensive error handling to ensure the UI would remain functional even if errors occurred during rendering:
```javascript
try {
    // ... rendering code ...
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in renderMessages preparations:', error);
    // Error recovery code to recreate control buttons if needed
    if (!this.controlButtonsContainer || this.controlButtonsContainer.destroyed) {
        this.controlButtonsContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, -30);
        this.container.add(this.controlButtonsContainer);
        this.addMessagePauseToggle();
        this.addCopyButton();
    }
}
```

## Architectural Benefits

### Improved Component Encapsulation
Each UI component now manages its own controls, following the principle of encapsulation:
- DirectBattleLog manages both pause and copy functionality
- BattleControlPanel focuses only on battle flow controls

### Enhanced User Experience
The new UI layout provides several UX improvements:
- More intuitive grouping of related controls
- Consistent styling and visual feedback
- More prominent, easier-to-find controls
- Cleaner visual appearance of both battle log and control panel

### Better Code Organization
The refactoring improved code organization by:
- Grouping related functionality in appropriate classes
- Following consistent patterns for button creation and styling
- Implementing proper tooltips and visual feedback
- Adding comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Testing Process
The implementation was tested with specific focus on:
1. Button functionality verification (pause/resume works, copy works)
2. Visual consistency and proper styling
3. Tooltip appearance and correctness
4. Error handling when components are destroyed
5. Performance during message rendering

## Lessons Learned
1. **Control Proximity**: UI controls should be placed near the elements they affect for intuitive user experience.
2. **Component Responsibility**: Each UI component should manage its own controls for better encapsulation.
3. **Container Management**: Proper handling of container hierarchy is critical for stable UI components.
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms ensures stable operation.

## Next Steps
Possible future enhancements could include:
1. Adding keyboard shortcuts for pause/copy functionality
2. Implementing battle log search functionality
3. Adding log filtering options
4. Enhancing the mobile experience for these controls


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.10_FixedSizeBattleLog =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.10 - Fixed-Size Battle Log Implementation

## Overview
This update fixes an issue with the Battle Log where it would start small and grow to its maximum size as messages were added. Additionally, it addresses a problem where text messages could extend beyond the visual frame boundaries. The solution implements a fixed-size battle log that starts at its maximum height immediately and includes additional buffer space to properly contain all text messages.

## Problem Analysis

After implementing the card frame styling for the Battle Log in version 0.7.5.9, two visual issues became apparent:

1. **Initial Size Issue**: The battle log would start very small (10px height) and expand as messages were added, reaching its maximum height only after several messages. This created an inconsistent visual appearance and made the UI feel less polished.

2. **Text Overflow Issue**: When messages with multiple lines were added, the text would sometimes extend beyond the bottom edge of the white border frame, especially when several long messages were displayed in succession. This created a visual disconnect where text appeared to "float" outside the card frame.

Analysis of the code revealed these specific causes:

1. The `createCardFrame()` method was using a placeholder height of 10px, with the expectation that `renderMessages()` would update it later.
2. The `renderMessages()` method was calculating height based on content, but didn't account for potential overflow.
3. The frame visuals were being updated to match content height without additional buffer space.

## Implementation Solution

The solution addresses both issues through two key changes:

### 1. Fixed Maximum Height from Initialization

Modified the `createCardFrame()` method to use the maximum height immediately:

```javascript
// Before
const initialHeight = 10; // Placeholder height, will be updated in renderMessages

// After
const initialHeight = this.maxHeight; // Use maximum height from the start
```

Also updated the `renderMessages()` method to always maintain the maximum height regardless of content:

```javascript
// Before
const newHeight = Math.min(totalHeight + this.options.padding, this.maxHeight);
this.updateCardFrameVisuals(newHeight);

// After
this.updateCardFrameVisuals(this.maxHeight);
```

### 2. Added Buffer Space to Contain Text

Modified the `updateCardFrameVisuals()` method to add a fixed buffer to the frame height:

```javascript
// Added buffer to ensure text doesn't overflow the frame
const frameHeight = newHeight + 50; // Add 50px extra buffer

// Updated all references to use frameHeight instead of newHeight
this.backdrop.height = frameHeight - (style.borderWidth * 2);
```

The method now creates a frame that is 50 pixels taller than the content height calculation, ensuring that all text messages remain contained within the visual frame.

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Visual Appearance**: The battle log now maintains a consistent size from the start of the battle, creating a more polished and professional UI.

2. **Proper Text Containment**: All text messages, including multi-line ones, are properly contained within the visual frame, maintaining visual integrity.

3. **Improved User Experience**: The fixed-size approach eliminates the distracting effect of the battle log growing and changing size during gameplay.

4. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**: The consistent frame size better establishes the battle log as a permanent UI element rather than a dynamic one.

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows a two-part approach:

1. **Initial Size Establishment**: By setting the initial height to the maximum allowed height, we establish the frame's visual boundaries immediately.

2. **Buffer Space Addition**: The additional 50-pixel buffer provides extra space for text that might extend beyond the calculated content height, particularly when multi-line messages are present.

This approach leverages the existing code architecture without requiring substantial refactoring:

- No changes to the message rendering logic were needed
- The existing event system continues to work unchanged
- The visual styling (white border, nameplate, etc.) remains consistent

## Testing Considerations

To verify the implementation works correctly, testing should focus on:

1. **Initial Appearance**: The battle log should appear at full size immediately when a battle starts
2. **Message Containment**: All messages should remain within the frame's boundaries
3. **Message Scrolling**: As new messages are added, older ones should scroll out of view properly
4. **Nameplate Position**: The "Battle Log" nameplate should remain properly positioned at the bottom of the frame

## Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Consistency**: UI elements should maintain consistent dimensions when possible to create a polished appearance.

2. **Buffer Space Importance**: When dealing with dynamic content like text, including buffer space can prevent visual glitches from unexpected content sizes.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with a complete visual framework and then populating it with content (rather than growing the framework to match content) often creates a more professional UI experience.

4. **Fixed vs. Dynamic Sizing**: For UI elements with known maximum bounds, using fixed sizing from the start can eliminate jarring visual changes during use.

This implementation demonstrates how small changes to initialization and sizing logic can significantly improve the visual consistency and professional appearance of UI elements.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.9_CardFrameStylingForBattleLog =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.9 - Card Frame Styling for Battle Log

## Overview
This update applies the card frame visual styling to the Battle Log, creating a more consistent UI design language across the game. By adopting the same frame style used for character cards, the Battle Log now has a white bordered frame with semi-transparent backdrop and a dedicated nameplate section, improving both its aesthetic appearance and readability.

## Problem Analysis
Previously, the Battle Log used a simple semi-transparent rectangle as background with no defined border or structure. This created several issues:

1. **Visual Inconsistency**: The Battle Log looked disconnected from the character cards, using different visual language
2. **Poor Readability**: Without a proper border and structure, text would sometimes be difficult to read against different backgrounds
3. **Limited Visual Hierarchy**: No clear separation between the log's header and content areas
4. **Underutilized Design System**: The card frame component architecture was already well-established but not leveraged for the Battle Log

After reviewing the CardFrameVisualComponent implementation, it was clear that many of the same visual elements could be applied to enhance the Battle Log while maintaining a cohesive UI design language.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added Card Style Configuration

Added new configuration options to DirectBattleLog for card styling:

```javascript
// Card frame options
cardStyle: {
    borderWidth: 6,
    cornerRadius: 12,
    borderColor: 0xFFFFFF, // White border
    backgroundColor: 0x000000, // Black background
    backgroundAlpha: 0.4,
    nameplateHeight: 30,
    nameplateBgColor: 0x000000,
    nameplateBgAlpha: 0.6
}
```

These values match those used in the character card frames, ensuring visual consistency.

### 2. Created Card Frame Method

Implemented a new `createCardFrame()` method that builds the frame using Phaser's drawing methods:

```javascript
createCardFrame() {
    try {
        const style = this.options.cardStyle;
        const initialHeight = 10; // Placeholder height, will be updated in renderMessages

        // Create backdrop (semi-transparent background)
        this.backdrop = this.scene.add.rectangle(
            style.borderWidth, style.borderWidth, 
            this.width - (style.borderWidth * 2), initialHeight - (style.borderWidth * 2),
            style.backgroundColor,
            style.backgroundAlpha
        ).setOrigin(0, 0);
        this.container.add(this.backdrop);

        // Create frame border
        this.frameBorder = this.scene.add.graphics();
        this.frameBorder.lineStyle(style.borderWidth, style.borderColor, 1);
        this.frameBorder.strokeRoundedRect(
            0, 0,
            this.width, initialHeight,
            style.cornerRadius
        );
        this.container.add(this.frameBorder);

        // Add nameplate at the bottom
        this.nameplateBg = this.scene.add.rectangle(
            style.borderWidth, initialHeight - style.nameplateHeight,
            this.width - (style.borderWidth * 2), style.nameplateHeight,
            style.nameplateBgColor,
            style.nameplateBgAlpha
        ).setOrigin(0, 0);
        this.container.add(this.nameplateBg);

        // Add "Battle Log" text
        this.nameplateText = this.scene.add.text(
            this.width / 2, initialHeight - (style.nameplateHeight / 2),
            "Battle Log",
            {
                fontFamily: this.options.fontFamily,
                fontSize: 16,
                color: '#FFFFFF',
                align: 'center'
            }
        ).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);
        this.container.add(this.nameplateText);

        // Position nameplate and text properly
        this.updateCardFrameVisuals(initialHeight);

        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating card frame:', error);
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 3. Added Dynamic Resizing Support

Implemented `updateCardFrameVisuals()` method to handle resizing of the card frame as messages are added or removed:

```javascript
updateCardFrameVisuals(newHeight) {
    try {
        const style = this.options.cardStyle;
        
        // Update backdrop
        if (this.backdrop) {
            this.backdrop.height = newHeight - (style.borderWidth * 2);
        }
        
        // Update frame border
        if (this.frameBorder) {
            this.frameBorder.clear();
            this.frameBorder.lineStyle(style.borderWidth, style.borderColor, 1);
            this.frameBorder.strokeRoundedRect(
                0, 0,
                this.width, newHeight,
                style.cornerRadius
            );
        }
        
        // Update nameplate position
        if (this.nameplateBg) {
            this.nameplateBg.y = newHeight - style.nameplateHeight;
        }
        
        // Update nameplate text position
        if (this.nameplateText) {
            this.nameplateText.y = newHeight - (style.nameplateHeight / 2);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating card frame visuals:', error);
    }
}
```

### 4. Modified renderMessages() Method

Updated the `renderMessages()` method to recreate the card frame elements during container clearing:

```javascript
// Store current pause button state and position
const pauseToggleState = this.messageProcessingPaused;
const hadPauseToggle = !!this.pauseToggle;

// Remove the pause toggle from the container temporarily (without destroying it)
if (this.pauseToggle) {
    this.container.remove(this.pauseToggle, false); // false = don't destroy
}

// Now safely clear the container - this destroys all child objects including our frame elements
this.container.removeAll(true);

// Recreate card frame elements (they were destroyed by removeAll)
this.createCardFrame();

// Legacy background reference
this.background = this.backdrop;
```

**Note**: Initial implementation had a bug where it tried to re-use Phaser objects after destruction. This was fixed by always recreating the card frame elements after clearing the container.

### 5. Enhanced Cleanup Process

Improved the `destroy()` method to properly clean up all card frame elements:

```javascript
destroy() {
    // Clean up card frame elements explicitly
    if (this.frameBorder) {
        this.frameBorder.destroy();
        this.frameBorder = null;
    }
    
    if (this.backdrop) {
        this.backdrop.destroy();
        this.backdrop = null;
    }
    
    if (this.nameplateBg) {
        this.nameplateBg.destroy();
        this.nameplateBg = null;
    }
    
    if (this.nameplateText) {
        this.nameplateText.destroy();
        this.nameplateText = null;
    }
    
    // Destroy container which will clean up any remaining child objects
    if (this.container) {
        this.container.destroy();
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency**: The Battle Log now shares the same visual language as character cards, creating a more cohesive UI
2. **Improved Readability**: The defined border and structured layout make the Battle Log text easier to read
3. **Enhanced Aesthetics**: The white frame with nameplate creates a more polished and professional appearance
4. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between the nameplate section and message content
5. **Unified Design Language**: Reinforces the card-based UI metaphor throughout the game

## Defensive Programming Features

The implementation includes several defensive programming measures:

1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks in all new methods
2. **Proper Resource Management**: Recreate Phaser objects when container is cleared rather than trying to reuse destroyed objects
3. **Null Checks**: All object references are checked before use
4. **Proper Resource Cleanup**: Enhanced destroy method ensures all resources are properly cleaned up

## Hotfix Details

After initial implementation, a bug was discovered where Phaser objects were being destroyed by `container.removeAll(true)` but we attempted to re-add them to the container. This caused the error:

```
Error in renderMessages preparations: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sys')
```

The fix was to simplify the approach by always recreating the card frame elements after clearing the container, rather than trying to preserve and reuse references to Phaser objects that had been destroyed.

## Testing Considerations

To ensure the implementation works correctly, testing should focus on:

1. **Visual Appearance**: The Battle Log should have a white border, semi-transparent background, and nameplate with "Battle Log" text
2. **Dynamic Resizing**: As messages are added and removed, the card frame should resize properly
3. **Performance**: The card frame should not cause any noticeable performance impact
4. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks should occur when the Battle Log is destroyed

## Future Considerations

1. **Color Theme Options**: Consider allowing different color themes for the Battle Log frame
2. **Size Variants**: Implement size variants similar to the character card system
3. **Context-Specific Styling**: Enable different visual styles based on battle state (e.g., different border colors during critical moments)
4. **Animation Effects**: Add subtle animations for important messages

## Lessons Learned

1. **Design System Consistency**: Reusing established visual patterns improves overall UI cohesion
2. **Component Architecture**: Using similar patterns across different UI elements simplifies maintenance
3. **Phaser Graphics Flexibility**: The rendering approach using Graphics objects provides more visual control than basic rectangles
4. **Phaser Object Lifecycle**: Understanding how Phaser manages object destruction is critical - objects destroyed by `removeAll(true)` cannot be reused
5. **Defensive Recreation**: Sometimes it's cleaner to recreate objects than trying to preserve and restore them

This implementation demonstrates how to leverage existing visual design patterns to create a more cohesive UI experience while improving both aesthetics and functionality.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.8_FixBacklitShadowVisibility =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.8 - Fix Backlit Shadow Visibility in Turn Indicator

## Overview
This update resolves a critical visibility issue with the newly implemented "backlit shadow" effect for active turn indicators. After the initial implementation in version 0.7.5.7, the shadow was completely invisible despite being properly created and animated. This update corrects the z-order (depth) management and alpha handling to ensure the backlit shadow appears correctly behind the card while extending visibly around its edges.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the backlit shadow feature, testing revealed several issues preventing the shadow from being visible:

1. **Depth Management Issues**:
   - The `sendToBack()` call in `CardFrameInteractionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight()` was pushing the shadow too far back in the display list, causing it to be completely hidden behind other opaque elements.
   - The `glowContainer` in `CardFrameManager.js` did not have an explicit depth setting, causing potential z-order conflicts with other card elements.

2. **Alpha Handling Issues**:
   - The shadow was drawn using `fillStyle(color, 0)` which sets the fill alpha to 0, but then the tween was attempting to animate the object's overall alpha. This created a conflict where the fill itself had zero opacity regardless of the object's alpha value.

3. **Visual Layering**:
   - The card's components needed careful depth management to achieve the "backlit" effect where the shadow appears behind the main card frame but extends visibly around its edges.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Fixed Alpha Handling in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
Modified how the alpha is applied to the shadow graphics object:

```javascript
// Before:
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillStyle(this.config.activeTurn.backlitShadowColor, 0); // Start with alpha 0
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillRoundedRect(
    -shadowWidth / 2,
    -shadowHeight / 2,
    shadowWidth,
    shadowHeight,
    cornerRadius
);

// After:
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillStyle(this.config.activeTurn.backlitShadowColor, 1.0); // Use full opacity for fillStyle
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillRoundedRect(
    -shadowWidth / 2,
    -shadowHeight / 2,
    shadowWidth,
    shadowHeight,
    cornerRadius
);

// Set initial alpha to 0 for the fade-in animation
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.setAlpha(0);
```

This separates the fill opacity from the object's overall alpha, allowing the tween to properly animate from transparent to visible.

### 2. Improved Depth Management in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
Removed the problematic `sendToBack()` call and replaced it with an explicit depth setting:

```javascript
// Before:
// Add to glow container
this.glowContainer.add(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// Send to back to ensure it's behind the card
this.glowContainer.sendToBack(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// After:
// Add to glow container
this.glowContainer.add(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// Set explicit depth to ensure visibility
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.setDepth(5);
```

### 3. Set Explicit Depth for glowContainer in CardFrameManager.js
Added an explicit depth setting to ensure the glowContainer has the right z-order relative to other card components:

```javascript
// Before:
// Create glowContainer if not found
if (!glowContainer) {
    glowContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, 0);
    this.add(glowContainer);
    this.glowContainer = glowContainer;
    console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer.`);
}

// After:
// Create glowContainer if not found
if (!glowContainer) {
    glowContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, 0);
    this.add(glowContainer);
    this.glowContainer = glowContainer;
    
    // Set depth to ensure the backlit shadow is visible but behind the card frame
    this.glowContainer.setDepth(1);
    console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer and set depth to 1.`);
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Improved console logging to better track the depth settings for debugging:

```javascript
console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer and set depth to 1.`);
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Visible Backlit Effect**: The shadow now appears correctly behind the card while extending visibly around its edges, creating the intended "backlit" visual effect.

2. **Proper Visual Layering**: The depth management ensures that the shadow appears in the right visual layer relative to other card components.

3. **Smooth Animation**: The improved alpha handling allows the shadow to fade in and out smoothly during turn transitions.

4. **Enhanced Debugging**: The improved logging makes it easier to track depth settings and troubleshoot z-order issues.

5. **Better Developer Experience**: The explicit depth settings make the z-order relationships clearer and easier to understand for future development.

## Testing Results

Testing confirms that the backlit shadow is now visible as intended:
- The shadow extends beyond the card's edges, creating a white glow effect
- The shadow fades in smoothly when a character's turn begins
- The shadow fades out smoothly when a character's turn ends
- The shadow appears behind the card frame, creating a true "backlit" effect

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit Depth Management**: When working with layered Phaser elements, it's better to use explicit depth settings rather than relying on add order or methods like `sendToBack()`.

2. **Separate Fill Alpha from Object Alpha**: When working with Phaser Graphics objects, it's important to understand the difference between the fill alpha (set with `fillStyle`) and the object's overall alpha (set with `setAlpha`).

3. **Visual Debugging is Essential**: Visual effects like depth and alpha issues can be hard to diagnose without careful testing and visual debugging.

4. **Layered Architecture Complexity**: In a complex component-based architecture like CardFrame, z-order management needs special attention as it spans multiple components.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Effects that look fine in isolation may not work as expected when integrated into the full system, highlighting the importance of testing in the full context.

## Future Considerations

1. **Depth Constants**: Consider implementing a system of depth constants to make z-order relationships more explicit and consistent across components.

2. **Visual Layer Documentation**: Add documentation about the visual layering system to help future developers understand how different card elements should be positioned in the z-order.

3. **Refine Shadow Appearance**: Now that the shadow is visible, further refinements could be made to its appearance, such as adjusting the size, opacity, or adding a subtle blur effect for a softer glow.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.7_RemoveCardFrameOutwardGlow =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.7 - Remove Card Frame Outward Glow from Turn Indicator

## Overview
This update removes the team-colored outward glow effect from the active turn indicator system in the CardFrameInteractionComponent. The existing glow effect was difficult to make visible even after numerous attempts to adjust opacity and depth settings. This change establishes a clean baseline for implementing a new "backlit shadow" effect in an upcoming update, while maintaining the white frame highlight and size pulse effects that work well.

## Problem Analysis
The outward glow effect in the turn indicator system had persistent visibility issues:

1. **Low Visibility**: Despite several attempts to increase opacity and adjust other settings, the team-colored outward glow remained difficult to see.
2. **Z-Order Conflicts**: The glow layers were frequently obscured by other visual elements due to depth/z-order conflicts.
3. **Inconsistent Appearance**: The glow effect appeared differently across various character types and backgrounds, leading to an inconsistent user experience.
4. **Code Complexity**: The glow implementation added significant complexity to the turn indicator system with minimal visual benefit.

After attempting several fixes (including setting higher z-order, increasing opacity values, and adjusting layer settings), we decided to completely remove the outward glow and focus on a different visual approach for indicating active turns.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Modified INTERACTION_DEFAULTS
Removed all outward glow-related properties from the activeTurn configuration:
```javascript
// Before:
activeTurn: {
    glowColorPlayer: 0x4488FF,     // Blue glow for player team
    glowColorEnemy: 0xFF4444,      // Red glow for enemy team
    glowIntensity: 1.0,            // Intensity of the glow effect (0-1)
    pulseScale: 1.05,              // Scale factor during pulse animation
    pulseDuration: 700,            // Duration of one pulse cycle in ms
    frameFadeDuration: 250,        // Duration of white frame highlight fade in/out
    priority: true                 // Whether turn highlighting takes visual priority over selection
}

// After:
activeTurn: {
    pulseScale: 1.05,              // Scale factor during pulse animation
    pulseDuration: 700,            // Duration of one pulse cycle in ms
    frameFadeDuration: 250,        // Duration of white frame highlight fade in/out
    priority: true                 // Whether turn highlighting takes visual priority over selection
}
```

### 2. Modified showActiveTurnHighlight() Method
Removed all glow-related code from the method:
```javascript
// Before:
showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType) {
    // ...
    // Get appropriate glow color based on team
    let glowColor;
    if (teamType === 'player') {
        glowColor = this.config.activeTurn.glowColorPlayer;
    } else if (teamType === 'enemy') {
        glowColor = this.config.activeTurn.glowColorEnemy;
    } else {
        // Default to type color if team not specified
        glowColor = this.typeColor;
        console.warn(`CardFrameInteractionComponent: Unknown team type '${teamType}', using type color for active turn glow`);
    }
    
    // Apply glow effect
    this.applyActiveTurnGlow(glowColor);
    // ...
}

// After:
showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType) {
    // ...
    // Removed glow color selection and applyActiveTurnGlow call
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Modified hideActiveTurnHighlight() Method
Removed the code that destroys the active turn glow:
```javascript
// Before:
hideActiveTurnHighlight() {
    // ...
    // Remove active turn glow
    if (this.activeTurnGlow && this.glowContainer) {
        this.activeTurnGlow.destroy();
        this.activeTurnGlow = null;
    }
    // ...
}

// After:
hideActiveTurnHighlight() {
    // ...
    // Glow removal code removed
    // ...
}
```

### 4. Neutered applyActiveTurnGlow() Method
Replaced the method implementation with a console message and return statement:
```javascript
// Before:
applyActiveTurnGlow(glowColor) {
    try {
        if (!this.glowContainer || !this.glowContainer.scene) {
            console.error('CardFrameInteractionComponent.applyActiveTurnGlow: glowContainer not set or invalid');
            return;
        }
        
        // Clear existing glow effects if this is the active turn (priority)
        if (this.config.activeTurn.priority) {
            this.removeGlowEffect();
        }
        
        // Create a new graphics object for the active turn glow
        const activeTurnGlow = this.scene.add.graphics();
        
        // Apply a stronger glow effect with more layers for a more distinct look
        const intensity = this.config.activeTurn.glowIntensity;
        const layers = this.config.glow.layers + 1; // Add one extra layer for active turn
        
        // Draw multiple glow layers for a soft effect
        for (let i = 0; i < layers; i++) {
            const padding = this.config.glow.paddingBase + (i * this.config.glow.paddingIncrement);
            const layerOpacity = this.config.glow.opacityBase * intensity * (1 - i * this.config.glow.opacityDecrement);
            
            activeTurnGlow.fillStyle(glowColor, layerOpacity);
            activeTurnGlow.fillRoundedRect(
                -this.config.width / 2 - padding,
                -this.config.height / 2 - padding,
                this.config.width + (padding * 2),
                this.config.height + (padding * 2),
                this.config.cornerRadius + padding / 2
            );
        }
        
        // Add to glow container
        this.glowContainer.add(activeTurnGlow);
        
        // Store reference to this specific glow for removal later
        this.activeTurnGlow = activeTurnGlow;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrameInteractionComponent: Error applying active turn glow:', error);
    }
}

// After:
/**
 * Apply the active turn glow effect
 * @private
 * @param {number} glowColor - Color for the glow effect
 * @deprecated - This method is no longer used for active turn highlighting
 */
applyActiveTurnGlow(glowColor) {
    console.log('applyActiveTurnGlow called but is now deprecated for active turn');
    return;
}
```

### 5. Updated cleanup() Method
Removed the active turn glow cleanup code:
```javascript
// Before:
cleanup() {
    // ...
    // Clean up active turn glow
    if (this.activeTurnGlow) {
        this.activeTurnGlow.destroy();
        this.activeTurnGlow = null;
    }
    // ...
}

// After:
cleanup() {
    // ...
    // Active turn glow cleanup code removed
    // ...
}
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Simplified Visual System**: The turn indicator now uses just two clear visual cues (white frame + size pulse) without conflicting with the planned "backlit shadow" effect.

2. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removing the glow effect simplifies the component and reduces potential points of failure.

3. **Clear Baseline**: Establishes a clean starting point for the upcoming "backlit shadow" effect implementation.

4. **Improved Performance**: Removes the need to create and manage multiple graphics objects for the glow effect, potentially improving performance.

5. **Better Code Maintainability**: The simplified code is easier to understand and maintain going forward.

## Testing Considerations

During testing, we should verify:

1. The white frame highlight still works correctly when a character's turn begins/ends
2. The size pulse animation continues to function as expected
3. The turn indication is still clear enough without the glow effect
4. No visual artifacts remain from the removed glow effect
5. No errors appear in the console when a character's turn changes

## Future Work

This change is part of a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase A (Current)**: Remove existing outward glow logic to establish a clean baseline
2. **Phase B (Upcoming)**: Implement a new "backlit shadow" visual effect for more impactful turn indication

The "backlit shadow" effect will be implemented in a future update and should provide a more distinctive visual indicator without the visibility issues of the outward glow approach.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Layered Visual Feedback**: The white frame highlight and size pulse proved more effective than the subtle glow. When designing visual indicators, high-contrast elements (like white borders) often work better than subtle color effects.

2. **z-order/depth management**: Future visual effects need careful consideration of z-ordering and proper depth setting to ensure visibility. The outward glow effect highlights how elements can be easily obscured without proper depth management.

3. **Configuration Management**: While we removed certain configuration options, we maintained the general glow configuration for selection and hover effects, showcasing the importance of modular configuration design.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: By implementing visual feedback in stages, we can evaluate the effectiveness of each element independently and make targeted improvements where needed.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.6_ConnectWhiteHighlightToTurnSystem =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.6 - Connect Card Frame White Highlight to Turn System

## Overview
This update completes the implementation of the enhanced turn indicator system by connecting the white frame highlight effect created in v0.7.5.5 to the turn indicator logic in the `CardFrameInteractionComponent`. Now when a character's turn begins, its card will display a smooth, fading white border, a team-colored external glow, and a subtle size pulse - creating a multi-layered visual indicator that clearly identifies the active character.

## Problem Analysis
In v0.7.5.5, we implemented the `setFrameWhiteHighlight()` method in `CardFrameVisualComponent.js` that provides the ability to show/hide a white frame highlight with smooth transitions. However, this capability was not yet integrated with the turn indicator system - specifically, the `showActiveTurnHighlight()` and `hideActiveTurnHighlight()` methods in `CardFrameInteractionComponent.js` did not call this new method. This meant the white highlight visual effect was available but not used.

The challenge was to ensure proper communication between these components:
1. `CardFrameInteractionComponent` needed to access the `CardFrameVisualComponent` through the component hierarchy
2. The timing of the white frame highlight needed to coordinate with the existing team-colored glow and size pulsing
3. The system needed to gracefully handle cases where the visual component might not be available

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added Configuration Option
Added a new configuration option to the `activeTurn` settings in `CardFrameInteractionComponent.js`:
```javascript
frameFadeDuration: 250, // Duration of white frame highlight fade in/out
```
This allows for independent control of the white frame highlight transition timing.

### 2. Enhanced `showActiveTurnHighlight()`
Updated the `showActiveTurnHighlight()` method to call the white frame highlight method:
```javascript
// Apply white frame highlight to the visual component
if (this.container && this.container.visualComponent && 
    typeof this.container.visualComponent.setFrameWhiteHighlight === 'function') {
    const frameFadeDuration = (this.config.activeTurn.frameFadeDuration !== undefined) ? 
        this.config.activeTurn.frameFadeDuration : (this.config.activeTurn.pulseDuration / 2);
    this.container.visualComponent.setFrameWhiteHighlight(true, frameFadeDuration);
} else {
    console.warn('CardFrameInteractionComponent: visualComponent or setFrameWhiteHighlight method not available.');
}
```

### 3. Enhanced `hideActiveTurnHighlight()`
Similarly updated the `hideActiveTurnHighlight()` method to remove the white frame highlight:
```javascript
// Remove white frame highlight from the visual component
if (this.container && this.container.visualComponent && 
    typeof this.container.visualComponent.setFrameWhiteHighlight === 'function') {
    const frameFadeDuration = (this.config.activeTurn.frameFadeDuration !== undefined) ? 
        this.config.activeTurn.frameFadeDuration : (this.config.activeTurn.pulseDuration / 2);
    this.container.visualComponent.setFrameWhiteHighlight(false, frameFadeDuration);
} else {
    console.warn('CardFrameInteractionComponent: visualComponent or setFrameWhiteHighlight method not available for hiding frame highlight.');
}
```

### 4. Fail-Safe Component Communication
Implemented comprehensive safety checks to ensure the code works even if the component structure is not as expected:
- Verifying that `this.container` exists
- Verifying that `this.container.visualComponent` exists
- Checking if the `setFrameWhiteHighlight` method is available
- Providing detailed warning messages when components or methods are missing

## Technical Details

### Component Communication
This implementation relies on the component hierarchy established in the CardFrame system:
1. `CardFrame` â†’ `CardFrameManager` â†’ `CardFrameVisualComponent`
2. `CardFrameInteractionComponent` accesses the `visualComponent` through its container (the `CardFrameManager`)

This access pattern follows the established component architecture where:
- `CardFrameManager` is responsible for managing all components
- Components can access each other through the manager
- Each component maintains responsibility for its specific domain

### Timing Coordination
The implementation ensures smooth coordination of timing between different visual effects:
- Team-colored glow effect (controlled by `CardFrameInteractionComponent`)
- Size pulse animation (controlled by `CardFrameInteractionComponent`)
- White frame highlight (implemented in `CardFrameVisualComponent` but triggered by `CardFrameInteractionComponent`)

The `frameFadeDuration` configuration option allows fine-tuning the white frame highlight transition timing independently from the pulse animation.

### Backward Compatibility
The implementation maintains backward compatibility by:
- Providing appropriate defaults if `frameFadeDuration` is not specified
- Gracefully handling cases where components or methods are missing
- Not altering the existing behavior of team-colored glows and size pulses

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Visual Clarity**: The combination of white frame highlight, team-colored glow, and size pulse creates a multi-layered visual indicator that clearly identifies the active character
2. **Customizable Timing**: The new `frameFadeDuration` configuration option allows fine-tuning the white frame highlight transition timing
3. **Smooth User Experience**: All visual effects use smooth transitions to prevent jarring changes
4. **Robust Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling ensures the system works even if components are missing or misconfigured

## Complete Turn Indicator System

With this implementation, the complete turn indicator visual system now includes:
1. **White Frame Highlight**: The card's frame border smoothly transitions to white
2. **Team-Colored External Glow**: Blue for player team characters, red for enemy team
3. **Subtle Size Pulse**: The card gently pulses to draw attention

This layered approach ensures that the active character is clearly visible even in complex battle scenarios with multiple characters.

## Testing Considerations

This change should be tested by:
1. Verifying that all three visual effects (white frame, team glow, size pulse) appear when a character's turn begins
2. Confirming that all effects are properly removed when a character's turn ends
3. Testing with different card variants, team types, and character types
4. Ensuring smooth transitions between character turns
5. Verifying proper behavior when characters are defeated or otherwise removed from battle

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Communication**: Proper component communication is essential for creating cohesive visual effects that span multiple components
2. **Layered Visual Indicators**: Using multiple visual indicators with different characteristics (color, animation, brightness) helps ensure information is accessible to all players
3. **Defensive Programming**: Comprehensive error checking and fallbacks are crucial for maintaining system stability across different scenarios
4. **Configuration Options**: Providing specific configuration options for timing and other properties allows for fine-tuning visual effects without code changes


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.5_CardFrameWhiteHighlight =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.5 - Card Frame White Highlight Implementation

## Overview
This update enhances the card frame turn indicator system by implementing a white frame highlight effect that appears when it's a character's turn. The highlight is a smooth, fading white border that overlays the card's existing type-colored frame, making it very clear which character is currently active.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the new card frame turn highlighting in previous versions (0.7.5.1-0.7.5.4), user testing revealed that while the team-colored glow and size pulsing were improvements over the old floor ellipses, the active character could still be difficult to identify at a glance, especially in complex battle scenarios with multiple characters.

The specific issues identified were:
1. The external glow effect could sometimes blend with the background or be obscured by other UI elements
2. The subtle size pulsing animation was not always immediately visible to players
3. The type-colored frame remained the same during a character's turn, lacking visual differentiation

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added White Highlight Layer
The solution implemented adds a separate graphic layer with a white frame border that:
- Overlays the existing type-colored frame
- Has the same dimensions and properties as the base frame
- Smoothly fades in when activated and fades out when deactivated

### 2. CardFrameVisualComponent Extension
Modified `CardFrameVisualComponent.js` by adding:
- A new instance variable `this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer` to track the highlight layer
- A new public method `setFrameWhiteHighlight(isHighlighted, duration = 250)` to manage the highlight state
- Proper resource cleanup in the component's `destroy()` method

### 3. Smooth Transitions
Implemented smooth transitions using tweens:
- Fade-in animation when a character becomes active
- Fade-out animation when a character's turn ends
- Resource cleanup after fade-out completes

### 4. Robust Error Handling
Added comprehensive error handling:
- Validating scene and container references
- Safely handling tween creation and cleanup
- Providing fallbacks for environments where tweens aren't available

## Technical Approach

### White Highlight Implementation
The white highlight is implemented as a separate graphics layer that directly mirrors the base frame's shape:

```javascript
// Create white highlight frame
this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer = this.scene.add.graphics();

// Draw the white frame border with same dimensions as the base frame
this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer.lineStyle(this.config.borderWidth, WHITE_COLOR, this.config.frameAlpha);
this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer.strokeRoundedRect(
    -this.config.width / 2,
    -this.config.height / 2,
    this.config.width,
    this.config.height,
    this.config.cornerRadius
);
```

### Animation System
The animation system uses Phaser's tween engine for smooth transitions:

```javascript
// Animate fade-in
this.scene.tweens.add({
    targets: this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer,
    alpha: this.config.frameAlpha,
    duration: duration,
    ease: 'Sine.easeOut'
});
```

### Resource Management
The implementation includes careful resource management to prevent memory leaks:

```javascript
// Clean up after fade-out completes
if (this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer && this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer.scene) {
    this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer.destroy();
    this.whiteHighlightFrameLayer = null;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Visual Clarity**: The white highlight provides a clear, universal indicator of the active character
2. **Layered Visual Feedback**: The white frame works in conjunction with existing team-colored glow and size pulsing
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in and fade-out animations prevent jarring visual changes
4. **Consistent Visual Language**: White is universally recognized as a highlight color, reducing cognitive load

## Future Improvements

For the next phase (Part 2), we will:
1. Connect this new visual effect to the active turn system by modifying the `CardFrameInteractionComponent`
2. Ensure the white highlight works in harmony with the existing team-colored glow and pulsing effects
3. Add configuration options to adjust the intensity and duration of the white highlight
4. Add proper documentation for the new visual effect in the component architecture documentation

## Testing Considerations

This change should be tested by:
1. Verifying that the white highlight appears and disappears with proper fade transitions
2. Confirming that it stacks correctly with the existing team-colored glow
3. Ensuring no memory leaks or performance impacts occur during extended play sessions
4. Testing with different card variants and type colors to ensure visual consistency

## Lessons Learned

1. **Layered Visual Feedback**: Using multiple visual indicators (color, animation, highlight) helps ensure information is accessible to all players
2. **Component Separation**: The clean separation between components allowed us to add this feature without modifying the interaction component yet
3. **Resource Management**: Careful tracking and cleanup of graphics objects is essential for maintaining performance
4. **Animation Timing**: Smooth transitions are critical for maintaining a polished visual experience


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.4_DisableOldTurnIndicator =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.4 - Disable and Remove the Old TurnIndicator System

## Overview
This update completely disables and removes the old TurnIndicator system (that used flattened ellipses below characters) to fully transition to the new card frame turn highlighting system implemented in v0.7.5.1-0.7.5.3. This resolves the issue where both the old ellipse indicators and the new card frame pulse effects were appearing simultaneously.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the new card frame turn highlighting in versions 0.7.5.1 through 0.7.5.3, we observed that both indicators were appearing at the same time:

1. **The new pulsing card highlight** was properly working through the delegation chain:  
   CharacterSprite â†’ CardFrame â†’ CardFrameManager â†’ CardFrameInteractionComponent

2. **The old ellipse indicators** were still being created and shown through the original system:  
   TeamDisplayManager â†’ TeamContainer â†’ TurnIndicator

This dual visualization was confusing and visually cluttered. Since we have fully implemented the new card frame turn indicator system, the old system needed to be completely removed.

## Implementation Solution

To fully disable the old TurnIndicator system, we implemented changes across multiple files:

### 1. TeamContainer.js
- Commented out the TurnIndicator instantiation in the constructor
- Modified `showTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Remove all logic related to the old TurnIndicator
  - Only call `sprite.highlight()` to activate the new card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Updated `clearTurnIndicators()` to:
  - Remove all TurnIndicator-related code
  - Directly call `sprite.unhighlight()` to clear card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Commented out TurnIndicator cleanup in the `destroy()` method

### 2. TeamDisplayManager.js
- Modified `createTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Not create any TurnIndicator instances
  - Set `this.turnIndicator = null`
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Updated `updateTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Remove all logic related to the old TurnIndicator
  - Simply call `sprite.highlight()` to activate the new card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Commented out TurnIndicator cleanup in the `destroy()` method

### 3. index.html
- Commented out the `<script>` tag that loads TurnIndicator.js:
  ```html
  <!-- TurnIndicator - [DISABLED] Removed in v0.7.5.4 in favor of card frame turn highlighting -->
  <!-- <script src="js/phaser/components/battle/TurnIndicator.js"></script> -->
  ```

## Technical Approach
We took a strategic approach to "soft-deprecate" the TurnIndicator system rather than completely removing its code:

1. **Method Preservation with Deprecation**:
   - Maintained all TurnIndicator-related methods for backward compatibility
   - Added `@deprecated` JSDoc tags to clearly mark deprecated methods
   - Added descriptive comments explaining the deprecation reason
   
2. **Commented Code Instead of Removal**:
   - Used commented blocks to preserve the original implementation
   - Added `[DISABLED]` markers in comments
   - Preserved the logic for documentation purposes while preventing execution

3. **Method Redirection**:
   - Modified methods to call the new system (`highlight()`/`unhighlight()`) directly
   - Added log statements to indicate the deprecation when verbose logging is enabled

4. **Script Loading Prevention**:
   - Commented out the script loading in index.html to prevent the TurnIndicator class from being available
   - This ensures that no new TurnIndicator instances can be created

## Benefits
1. **Visual Clarity**: Only one turn indicator system appears now, eliminating confusion and visual clutter
2. **Code Cleanliness**: The new system uses proper component delegation and follows the established architecture
3. **Performance**: Removes unnecessary object creation and animations
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Any code calling the old methods still works through redirection to the new system
5. **Documentation Preservation**: Original implementation is preserved in comments for future reference

## Future Improvements
As mentioned in the task description, the next phase will be to enhance the new card frame turn indicator to make the card frame brighter instead of just pulsing. This will involve modifying the `CardFrameInteractionComponent.js` file to adjust the visual feedback for active turns.

## Testing Considerations
This change should be tested by:
1. Verifying that only the card frame pulse appears during battles
2. Confirming no errors occur related to missing TurnIndicator class or methods
3. Ensuring character turns are still clearly indicated throughout battle
4. Checking that there are no console errors related to the TurnIndicator system

## Lessons Learned
1. **Component Isolation**: Proper component isolation makes it easier to replace one visual system with another
2. **Deprecation Strategy**: Using a "comment-out" approach instead of complete code removal provides better backward compatibility
3. **Method Redirection**: Redirecting old methods to new functionality minimizes the impact of architectural changes
4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear explanations in comments help future developers understand the transition


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.3_CompleteTurnIndicatorDelegationChain =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.3 - Complete Turn Indicator Delegation Chain

## Overview
This update resolves the TypeError encountered when attempting to use the new card frame turn indicator methods by completing the delegation chain that was missing between the components. The update adds the necessary `showActiveTurnHighlight` and `hideActiveTurnHighlight` methods to both CardFrameManager.js and CardFrame.js, ensuring the proper flow of method calls from CharacterSprite down to CardFrameInteractionComponent.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the turn indicator functionality in CardFrameInteractionComponent (in version 0.7.5.1) and connecting it to CharacterSprite.js (in version 0.7.5.2), we encountered errors:

```
TypeError: this.cardFrame.hideActiveTurnHighlight is not a function
```

This error indicated that while CardFrameInteractionComponent had the new turn indicator methods, the intermediate components in the delegation chain (CardFrame and CardFrameManager) were missing the required methods to pass the calls down the chain.

The delegation chain was incomplete:
- CharacterSprite attempted to call `this.cardFrame.showActiveTurnHighlight()/hideActiveTurnHighlight()`
- CardFrame lacked these methods, causing TypeError
- CardFrameManager also lacked these methods, meaning even if CardFrame had been implemented, it couldn't delegate further
- CardFrameInteractionComponent had the methods but was unreachable due to the broken chain

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Added Methods to CardFrameManager.js

Added two new methods to CardFrameManager.js that delegate to the interaction component:

```javascript
/**
 * Show active turn highlighting for the character
 * Indicates that it's this character's turn in battle
 * @param {string} teamType - 'player' or 'enemy' team
 * @returns {boolean} - Success state
 */
showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType) {
    // Delegate to interaction component if available
    if (this.interactionComponent && typeof this.interactionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight === 'function') {
        return this.interactionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType);
    } else {
        console.warn(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): showActiveTurnHighlight called but interactionComponent is not available or lacks method.`);
        return false;
    }
}

/**
 * Hide active turn highlighting for the character
 * Used when it's no longer this character's turn
 * @returns {boolean} - Success state
 */
hideActiveTurnHighlight() {
    // Delegate to interaction component if available
    if (this.interactionComponent && typeof this.interactionComponent.hideActiveTurnHighlight === 'function') {
        return this.interactionComponent.hideActiveTurnHighlight();
    } else {
        console.warn(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): hideActiveTurnHighlight called but interactionComponent is not available or lacks method.`);
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 2. Added Methods to CardFrame.js

Added corresponding methods to CardFrame.js that delegate to the manager:

```javascript
/**
 * Show active turn highlighting for the character
 * Indicates that it's this character's turn in battle
 * @param {string} teamType - 'player' or 'enemy' team
 * @returns {boolean} - Success state
 */
showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType) {
    try {
        // If component system is active, delegate to manager
        if (this.getConfig('useComponentSystem', true) && this.manager) {
            // Delegate to manager if method exists
            if (typeof this.manager.showActiveTurnHighlight === 'function') {
                return this.manager.showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType);
            } else {
                console.warn(`CardFrame (${this.getConfig('characterName', 'Unknown')}): Manager exists but has no showActiveTurnHighlight method`);
            }
        }
        
        // Log warning for delegation failure
        console.warn(`CardFrame (${this.getConfig('characterName', 'Unknown')}): showActiveTurnHighlight delegation failed, turn highlight will be missing`);
        return false;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error delegating showActiveTurnHighlight:', error);
        return false;
    }
}

/**
 * Hide active turn highlighting for the character
 * Used when it's no longer this character's turn
 * @returns {boolean} - Success state
 */
hideActiveTurnHighlight() {
    try {
        // If component system is active, delegate to manager
        if (this.getConfig('useComponentSystem', true) && this.manager) {
            // Delegate to manager if method exists
            if (typeof this.manager.hideActiveTurnHighlight === 'function') {
                return this.manager.hideActiveTurnHighlight();
            } else {
                console.warn(`CardFrame (${this.getConfig('characterName', 'Unknown')}): Manager exists but has no hideActiveTurnHighlight method`);
            }
        }
        
        // Log warning for delegation failure
        console.warn(`CardFrame (${this.getConfig('characterName', 'Unknown')}): hideActiveTurnHighlight delegation failed, turn highlight will not be removed`);
        return false;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('CardFrame: Error delegating hideActiveTurnHighlight:', error);
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complete Delegation Chain

With these changes, the complete delegation chain is now established:

1. CharacterSprite.highlight() determines team type and calls CardFrame.showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType)
2. CardFrame.showActiveTurnHighlight() delegates to CardFrameManager.showActiveTurnHighlight()
3. CardFrameManager.showActiveTurnHighlight() delegates to CardFrameInteractionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight()
4. CardFrameInteractionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight() implements the actual visual effects

The same flow exists for the unhighlight/hideActiveTurnHighlight methods.

## Key Implementation Features

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Both methods use the established pattern of checking for component/method existence and providing detailed error messages.

2. **Comprehensive Warning Messages**: The delegation methods include clear warning messages that identify which component is missing if delegation fails.

3. **Full Try-Catch Protection**: In CardFrame.js, all methods are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent errors from breaking the game logic.

4. **Return Value Propagation**: All methods properly return boolean success values to allow callers to detect failures.

5. **Method Documentation**: Complete JSDoc comments on all methods for consistent code documentation.

## Benefits

1. **Complete Component Chain**: The implementation completes the delegation chain, allowing all components to work together properly.

2. **Error Resolution**: Fixes the TypeError by ensuring all required methods exist in the chain.

3. **Consistent Architecture**: Maintains the established CardFrame component architecture with proper delegation patterns.

4. **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provides detailed warning messages for debugging if any part of the component chain is unavailable.

5. **Modularity**: Preserves the modular nature of the component system, with each component responsible for its specific domain.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complete Delegation Chains**: When adding new features to a component-based system, all components in the delegation chain must be updated, not just the endpoints.

2. **Consistent Method Signatures**: Maintaining consistent method signatures throughout the delegation chain is critical for proper function.

3. **Error Handling at Every Level**: Each component in the chain needs its own error handling to provide detailed feedback about where issues occur.

4. **Method Documentation**: Properly documenting methods across all components helps maintain consistency in implementation.

5. **Testing the Full Chain**: When implementing new features, it's important to test the entire delegation chain, not just individual components.

## Testing Considerations

To verify the implementation, the following test scenarios should be considered:

1. **Basic Turn Flow**: Ensure that turn indicators appear correctly on the active character and disappear when the turn ends.

2. **Error Recovery**: Test how the system handles cases where one component in the chain is missing or invalid.

3. **Team-Specific Styling**: Verify that player characters show blue highlighting and enemy characters show red highlighting.

4. **Warning Message Clarity**: Check that warning messages clearly indicate which component or method is missing if errors occur.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that characters not using the card representation don't experience errors.


===== CHANGELOG_0.7.5.2_CharacterSpriteTurnIndicatorIntegration =====

# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.2 - Character Sprite Turn Indicator Integration

## Overview
This update completes the implementation of the new card frame turn indicator system by connecting the game's existing turn logic to the previously implemented CardFrameInteractionComponent methods. The changes focus on modifying CharacterSprite.js to properly invoke the new turn highlighting methods instead of relying on the now deprecated TurnIndicator system.

## Problem Analysis
After successfully implementing the new turn indicator functionality in CardFrameInteractionComponent (in version 0.7.5.1), we needed to connect this functionality to the existing game logic that determines whose turn it is. The key challenges were:

1. **Maintaining Existing Logic Flow**: The game already had a well-established event flow (`CHARACTER_ACTION` event â†’ `BattleScene.updateActiveCharacterVisuals()` â†’ `TeamDisplayManager.updateActiveCharacterVisuals()` â†’ `CharacterSprite.highlight()/unhighlight()`). This flow needed to be preserved.

2. **Supporting Both Representations**: While we're transitioning to the card-based representation, the system needed to handle characters regardless of their representation method.

3. **Deprecating Old System**: The previous TurnIndicator system needed to be properly phased out without affecting gameplay.

4. **Team-Specific Styling**: The new turn indicator uses team-specific colors, so the character's team information needed to be properly passed to the highlight method.

## Implementation Solution

### Modified `highlight()` Method
The `highlight()` method was updated to:

```javascript
highlight() {
    try {
        // If this character is using a card frame, use the new highlight method
        if (this.cardConfig && this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
            // Determine the character's team type (convert to lowercase to match expected parameter)
            const teamType = this.character?.team?.toLowerCase() || 'player';
            
            // Apply the new card frame turn highlight
            this.cardFrame.showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType);
            console.log(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Applied card frame turn highlight for team ${teamType}.`);
            return true;
        } else {
            // Not using card frame - old turn indicator logic would apply, but is now deprecated
            console.log(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Not a card frame. Old turn indicator logic would apply (now deprecated and removed).`);
            return false;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Error in highlight method:`, error);
        return false;
    }
}
```

Key aspects of this implementation:
- Uses a try-catch block for robust error handling
- Checks if the character is using a card representation
- Determines the team type from character data
- Calls the new `showActiveTurnHighlight()` method with the team type
- Logs appropriate messages for monitoring
- Returns boolean success value

### Modified `unhighlight()` Method
Similarly, the `unhighlight()` method was updated to:

```javascript
unhighlight() {
    try {
        // If this character is using a card frame, use the new unhighlight method
        if (this.cardConfig && this.cardConfig.enabled && this.cardFrame) {
            // Remove the card frame turn highlight
            this.cardFrame.hideActiveTurnHighlight();
            console.log(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Removed card frame turn highlight.`);
            return true;
        } else {
            // Not using card frame - old turn indicator logic would apply, but is now deprecated
            return false;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`CharacterSprite (${this.character?.name}): Error in unhighlight method:`, error);
        return false;
    }
}
```

Key aspects of this implementation:
- Uses a try-catch block for robust error handling
- Checks if the character is using a card representation
- Calls the new `hideActiveTurnHighlight()` method
- Logs appropriate messages for monitoring
- Returns boolean success value

### Updated JSDoc Comments
Both methods received improved JSDoc comments to document their purpose and return values:

```javascript
/**
 * Highlight this character as active for its turn
 * @returns {boolean} True if highlighting was successful, false otherwise
 */

/**
 * Remove highlight effect from this character
 * @returns {boolean} True if unhighlighting was successful, false otherwise
 */
```

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: The existing turn logic flow is maintained, with only the visual implementation changed.

2. **Graceful Deprecation**: The old TurnIndicator system is gracefully phased out with appropriate logging.

3. **Improved Visual Consistency**: All characters using the card representation now use the same visual style for turn indication.

4. **Team-Specific Styling**: Player and enemy teams now have distinct visual indicators (blue for player, red for enemy).

5. **Robust Error Handling**: The implementation includes comprehensive error handling to prevent any failures from affecting gameplay.

## Testing Considerations

To verify the implementation, the following test scenarios should be considered:

1. **Basic Turn Flow**: Ensure that turn indicators appear on the correct character when it's their turn.

2. **Mixed Representation Teams**: Test with teams that have both card-based and traditional representations to ensure both work correctly.

3. **Team Coloring**: Verify that player characters show blue highlighting and enemy characters show red highlighting.

4. **Error Recovery**: Test error cases (e.g., by temporarily breaking references) to ensure the error handling works properly.

5. **Visual State Transitions**: Ensure that when a character's turn ends, any previous selection/highlight state is properly restored.

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete Deprecation**: Consider fully removing the old TurnIndicator.js file in a future update once the new system is proven stable.

2. **Enhanced Transitions**: Add smoother transitions between turn changes for better visual feedback.

3. **Sound Integration**: Add audio cues for turn changes to complement the visual indicators.

4. **Accessibility Options**: Consider adding settings to adjust the intensity or type of turn indicators for accessibility.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: This implementation reinforces the value of the game's event-driven architecture, which made it possible to change the visual representation without modifying the core game logic.

2. **Component Delegation**: By using proper delegation patterns, we were able to add complex visual behaviors through a clean component interface.

3. **Graceful Deprecation**: Rather than removing the old system entirely at once, we followed a pattern of gradual replacement, maintaining backward compatibility during the transition.

4. **Defensive Programming**: The comprehensive error handling ensures that any issues with the turn indicator won't affect the core gameplay.

5. **Clear Visual Language**: The team-specific coloring provides a clearer visual language to distinguish player and enemy actions, improving gameplay clarity.
