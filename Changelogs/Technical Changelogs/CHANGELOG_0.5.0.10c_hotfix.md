# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c Hotfix - Battle Log UI Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses the missing Battle Log UI in the Phaser-based battle scene.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Battle Log Panel Loading

#### Problem
The BattleLogPanel component was created but not properly loaded in the HTML file, resulting in "BattleLogPanel class not found" errors.

#### Solution
- Added the missing script tag in index.html to load BattleLogPanel.js
- Enhanced the log panel size and visibility settings
- Improved error handling when the panel can't be initialized

#### Code Changes
- Added `<script src="js/phaser/components/battle/BattleLogPanel.js" defer></script>` to index.html
- Increased the panel size in BattleScene from 350px to 400px
- Improved visual settings for better readability (opacity, font size, padding)

### 2. UI Improvements for Battle Log

- Increased maximum message count from 20 to 30
- Improved text contrast and readability
- Enhanced panel size and positioning for better visibility

## Technical Notes

### Script Loading Order
The script loading order is critical in this application. The BattleLogPanel.js needs to be loaded before BattleScene.js attempts to use it. The defer attribute ensures that scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML file.

### Visual Enhancements
- Increased background opacity from 0.85 to 0.90
- Increased font size from 14px to 15px
- Increased padding from 10px to 12px

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test that the Battle Log UI now appears in the battle scene
2. Verify that battle events are logged properly
3. Test scrolling and ensure messages are readable

## Known Limitations
- The log panel position is fixed and might need adjustment for different screen sizes
- Very long messages might be truncated in the display
