# CHANGELOG 0.5.21b: Health Bar Update Diagnostics

## Issue Description
A persistent issue has been discovered where character health bars are not consistently updating in battle. Although the internal health values are correctly calculated and reflected in the battle log and end-of-turn summaries, the visual health bars for some characters fail to update. Interestingly, Drakarion's health bar updates correctly, but other characters' health bars (such as Caste, Sylvanna, and the defeated Lumina) don't reflect their actual health values.

## Diagnostic Approach
The approach taken was to implement temporary diagnostic logging throughout the entire health update chain to trace the data flow from the initial damage/healing calculation to the final UI update. The goal was to identify exactly where the breakdown occurs in the sequence.

## Implementation Details

### 1. BattleFlowController.js Diagnostic Logging
Added detailed logging to trace event dispatch for CHARACTER_DAMAGED and CHARACTER_HEALED events:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] applyActionEffect entry: actor=${action.actor.name}, target=${Array.isArray(action.target) ? 'multiple targets' : action.target.name}, ability=${action.ability?.name || 'Auto Attack'}`); 
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

Similar logging was added before dispatching events:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
const eventData = {
    character: action.target,
    target: action.target,
    newHealth: action.target.currentHp,
    maxHealth: action.target.stats.hp,
    amount: actualDamage,
    source: action.actor,
    ability: action.ability
};
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] Dispatching CHARACTER_DAMAGED for ${action.target.name} (${action.target.team}), HP: ${action.target.currentHp}/${action.target.stats.hp}, ID: ${action.target.uniqueId || action.target.id}`);
console.log('[HEALTH DEBUG] Event data:', eventData);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

### 2. DamageCalculator.js and HealingProcessor.js Diagnostic Logging
Added entry/exit logging to trace utility methods:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] DamageCalculator.applyDamage entry: target=${target.name}, amount=${amount}, source=${source?.name || 'null'}, damageType=${damageType}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

### 3. BattleScene.js Diagnostic Logging
Added detailed logging to trace event receipt and character identification:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] BattleScene.onCharacterDamaged entry: data received:`, data);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE

// Later in the method:
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] Character info: id=${character?.id}, uniqueId=${character?.uniqueId}, name=${character?.name}, team=${character?.team}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

### 4. TeamContainer.js Diagnostic Logging
Added logging for character sprite lookup and identification:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] TeamContainer.updateCharacterHealth called for ${typeof characterId === 'object' ? characterId?.name : characterId}, team: ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'player' : 'enemy'}, characterId: ${typeof characterId === 'object' ? characterId?.uniqueId || characterId?.id : characterId}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

And detailed logging for character sprite finding:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] TeamContainer.findCharacterSprite entry: character=${typeof character === 'object' ? character?.name : character}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE

// Later in the method:
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] Found by direct reference: ${sprite.character.name}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

### 5. CharacterSprite.js Diagnostic Logging
Added detailed logging for health updates and health bar rendering:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] CharacterSprite.updateHealth called for ${this.character?.name}, HP: ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE

// Later in the method:
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] CharacterSprite.updateHealth calling updateHealthBar for ${this.character?.name}`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

And final confirmation of health bar updates:

```javascript
// TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
// TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] CharacterSprite.updateHealthBar finished visual update for ${this.character?.name}: ${healthPercent * 100}% (${safeCurrentHealth}/${safeMaxHealth})`);
// END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
```

## Important Notes for Analysis

All diagnostic logs follow a consistent format with the `[HEALTH DEBUG]` prefix, making them easy to filter in the console. The diagnostic code has been carefully annotated with comments to ensure:

1. Clear identification as temporary diagnostic code
2. Easy removal/relocation after the bug is fixed
3. Minimal interference with the actual functionality

## Testing Methodology

The diagnostic logging should be tested by:

1. Running a battle with multiple characters
2. Observing the health update events in the console, filtering for `[HEALTH DEBUG]`
3. Following the complete chain from damage/healing calculation to visual update
4. Identifying patterns between characters that update correctly vs. those that don't
5. Comparing the data flow, especially character identifiers (id, uniqueId) between successful and failed updates

## Expected Outcomes

The expected diagnostic flow for a successful health update would be:

1. `applyActionEffect` logs the action details
2. Event dispatch for CHARACTER_DAMAGED or CHARACTER_HEALED
3. BattleScene.onCharacterDamaged/onCharacterHealed receives the event
4. TeamContainer.updateCharacterHealth is called with correct character ID
5. TeamContainer.findCharacterSprite successfully finds the character sprite
6. CharacterSprite.updateHealth and updateHealthBar execute the visual update

Any deviation from this flow for specific characters will help pinpoint the issue.

## Post-Fix Cleanup

After the health bar update issue is resolved, all diagnostic code should be removed or, if still needed, properly integrated into the refactored components (e.g., DamageCalculator.applyDamage) with appropriate logging levels.
