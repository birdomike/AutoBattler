# CHANGELOG 0.5.1.3: Sequential Action Indicators Fix

## Issue Summary
Players were experiencing a visual clarity problem at the start of battles where all characters would simultaneously display "Auto Attack" indicators. This created a confusing user experience as it appeared that all characters were attacking at once, despite the game's turn-based nature. The indicators worked correctly once the battle was underway, but the initialization phase was problematic.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to an architectural flaw in the event dispatching system within `BattleBridge.js`. Specifically:

1. The `BattleBridge` class patches various `BattleManager` methods to dispatch events when battle actions occur
2. The patched `generateCharacterAction` method was incorrectly dispatching `CHARACTER_ACTION` events during the action planning phase
3. During battle initialization, `generateTurnActions()` called `generateCharacterAction()` for all characters in sequence
4. This resulted in all `CHARACTER_ACTION` events firing nearly simultaneously during setup, causing all indicators to appear at once

Affected code in `BattleBridge.js`:

```javascript
// INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (Before)
if (originalGenerateCharacterAction) {
    this.battleManager.generateCharacterAction = function(character) {
        const action = originalGenerateCharacterAction.apply(this, arguments);
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.CHARACTER_ACTION, {
            character,
            action
        });
        return action;
    };
}
```

This was conceptually flawed because `generateCharacterAction()` should only plan what a character will do, not announce that they are actually doing it. The event should only be dispatched when the action is executed.

## Solution Implementation
The solution was to remove the incorrect event dispatch from the `generateCharacterAction` patch, as `executeNextAction()` already has the proper event dispatch in place for when actions are actually performed:

```javascript
// CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (After)
if (originalGenerateCharacterAction) {
    this.battleManager.generateCharacterAction = function(character) {
        const action = originalGenerateCharacterAction.apply(this, arguments);
        // Removed CHARACTER_ACTION dispatch from here - it should only happen during execution, not generation
        // This prevents simultaneous auto-attack indicators at battle start
        return action;
    };
}
```

## Technical Analysis
This bug was a classic example of event timing issues in systems with multiple layers:

1. **Architecture Concern**: The core issue involved improper separation of concerns between action planning (generation) and action execution
2. **Event Dispatch Timing**: Events should represent what is *happening now*, not what is *planned to happen later*
3. **Visual Clarity Impact**: The improper event timing created a misleading visual representation of the game state

The fix was minimally invasive, removing just the problematic event dispatch without affecting any other functionality. This maintains the event flow during actual turn execution where it works correctly.

## Testing Results
After implementing the fix:
- Battle initialization occurs without premature action indicators
- Character actions show their indicators sequentially as they take their turns
- No regression observed in normal combat flow
- The correct separation between action planning and execution is maintained

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **UI-side filtering**: We could have added a "battle ready" flag in the `BattleScene` to ignore early events, but this would have been treating a symptom rather than fixing the root cause
2. **Delayed indicator creation**: Another approach would have been to add timing delays in the ActionIndicator class, but this would have added complexity without addressing the fundamental event flow issue

The chosen solution of removing the incorrect event dispatch was the cleanest option that addressed the root cause directly.

## Future Considerations
This fix highlights an important principle about event dispatch timing in the bridge system: events should represent what is currently happening, not what is planned. This principle should be maintained for any future additions to the bridge system.
