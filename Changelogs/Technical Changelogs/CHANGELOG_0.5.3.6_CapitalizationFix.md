# CHANGELOG 0.5.3.6 - Status Effect Name Capitalization Fix

## Overview

This update addresses an issue where some status effect names were displayed in all-uppercase (e.g., "SHIELD", "IMMUNE", "REGEN") in status effect tooltips. The fix ensures all status effect names are consistently displayed with proper capitalization, which improves readability and visual polish.

## Issues Addressed

1. Status effect names coming from some data sources were appearing in all-caps
2. The previous name formatting system didn't account for this particular case
3. The abbreviation dictionary was missing entries for several common status effects

## Implementation Details

### 1. All-Uppercase Detection and Conversion

Added logic to detect and properly format all-uppercase names:

```javascript
// Check if it's all uppercase (like 'SHIELD', 'IMMUNE', etc.)
if (statusName === statusName.toUpperCase()) {
    // Convert all-caps to Title Case
    return statusName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + statusName.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}
```

This check is applied in two places:
1. For names already in a "user-friendly format" (no underscores, no status_ prefix)
2. After extracting the name part from IDs but before applying word-level formatting

### 2. Expanded Abbreviation Dictionary

Added comprehensive entries to the status effect name dictionary:

```javascript
const abbreviations = {
    // Previous entries
    'atk_up': 'Attack Up',
    'def_up': 'Defense Up',
    'regen': 'Regeneration',
    // ... other existing entries ...
    
    // New entries for common status effects
    'shield': 'Shield',
    'immune': 'Immunity',
    'taunt': 'Taunt',
    'burn': 'Burn',
    'stun': 'Stun',
    'freeze': 'Freeze',
    'bleed': 'Bleeding',
    'poison': 'Poison',
    'evade': 'Evasion',
    'reflect': 'Damage Reflect',
    'vulnerable': 'Vulnerability',
    'crit_up': 'Critical Chance Up'
};
```

The dictionary now includes entries for all common status effects, ensuring they display with consistent proper names even if they appear in different capitalization formats in the data source.

### 3. Case-Insensitive Abbreviation Lookup

Made the abbreviation lookup case-insensitive to handle varying capitalization in input data:

```javascript
// Check if this is a known abbreviation (case insensitive)
if (abbreviations[name.toLowerCase()]) {
    return abbreviations[name.toLowerCase()];
}
```

### 4. Fallback for Unconverted All-Caps Names

Added an extra safeguard for any all-caps names that might not be caught by the abbreviation dictionary:

```javascript
// Handle if the name is all uppercase (like 'SHIELD', 'IMMUNE', etc.)
if (name === name.toUpperCase()) {
    name = name.toLowerCase();
}
```

This ensures that even if a status effect name isn't in our dictionary but is in all-caps, it will be properly converted to lowercase before the word-level formatting is applied.

### 5. Null Safety Enhancement

Added protection against null or undefined status names:

```javascript
if (!statusName) return 'Unknown Effect';
```

## Testing

The fixes were tested with various status effect name formats:

1. **All-caps format**:
   - "SHIELD" → "Shield"
   - "IMMUNE" → "Immunity"
   - "REGEN" → "Regeneration"
   - "STUN" → "Stun"

2. **Mixed capitalization**:
   - "Poison" → "Poison" (preserved)
   - "Burn" → "Burn" (preserved)

3. **Status IDs with prefixes**:
   - "status_SHIELD" → "Shield"
   - "status_shield" → "Shield"

4. **Underscore separated terms**:
   - "damage_reflection" → "Damage Reflection"
   - "CRITICAL_BOOST" → "Critical Boost"

## Conclusion

This update ensures all status effect names are displayed with consistent, proper capitalization regardless of their format in the source data. It extends the previous tooltip text improvements, further enhancing the professional appearance and readability of the status effect system.

The changes provide a more polished user experience by eliminating the jarring appearance of all-caps text in status effect tooltips.
