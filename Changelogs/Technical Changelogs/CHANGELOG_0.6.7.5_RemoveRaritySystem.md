# Changelog: Rarity System Removal

## Version 0.6.7.5 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update removes the rarity system from the game as it was not being utilized in any gameplay mechanics. The rarity property and visual display elements have been removed from both the UI components and the character data definitions.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. UI Changes
The primary UI changes were made to `HeroDetailPanelManager.js`, where we removed the code that created and displayed rarity tags:

```javascript
// Removed from renderDetails()
const rarityTag = document.createElement('span');
rarityTag.className = 'detail-tag';
rarityTag.style.backgroundColor = this.rarityColors[hero.rarity];
rarityTag.textContent = hero.rarity;
detailTags.appendChild(rarityTag);
```

Similar code was also removed from the `updateExistingDetails()` method to ensure consistency. The code was replaced with comments indicating when the rarity tag was removed to maintain code clarity for future reference.

#### 2. Data Structure Changes
The "rarity" property was removed from all character definitions in `characters.json`. For example:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Caste",
  "type": "metal",
  "role": "Berserker",
  "rarity": "Epic",
  "actionDecisionLogic": "decideAction_PrioritizeOffense",
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Caste",
  "type": "metal",
  "role": "Berserker",
  "actionDecisionLogic": "decideAction_PrioritizeOffense",
  ...
}
```

This property was removed from all 8 character definitions in the file.

#### 3. Visual Impact
The removal of the rarity tags has a minimal visual impact on the UI. The hero detail display now shows only the type and role tags, resulting in a cleaner, more focused presentation:

**Before:**
- Hero name
- Type tags (color-coded)
- Role tag (gray)
- Rarity tag (color-coded based on rarity)

**After:**
- Hero name
- Type tags (color-coded)
- Role tag (gray)

### Rationale
The rarity system was initially intended to be used for character progression and collection mechanics. However, as the game evolved, the focus shifted to team-building and tactical combat without a progression system that utilized rarity. Since this property was not being used in any gameplay mechanics, it was removed to:

1. **Simplify Data Model**: Remove unused properties from the character data model
2. **Clean UI**: Remove visual elements that don't contribute to gameplay understanding
3. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Simplify the information presented to players

### Future Considerations

1. **Character Progression**: If a character progression system is implemented in the future, a different approach may be needed rather than reintroducing rarity.

2. **Existing Code**: The `rarityColors` definition in `TeamBuilderUI.js` has been left in place for now, as it might be useful for future features or if rarity is reintroduced in a different form.

3. **Data Persistence**: If save data exists that references character rarity, additional migration steps might be needed (not applicable in the current implementation).

### Lessons Learned

1. **Data-Driven Design**: This change reinforces the benefit of separating data (character definitions) from presentation (UI components), making it straightforward to add or remove properties without cascading changes.

2. **Documentation**: Adding clear comments where code was removed helps maintain historical context for future developers.

3. **Simplification**: Removing unused features can sometimes be as valuable as adding new ones, especially for reducing maintenance burden and cognitive load.
