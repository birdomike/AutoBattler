# CHANGELOG 0.5.1.3 - BattleManager Refactoring (Stage 1)

## Overview
This changelog documents the first stage of the BattleManager refactoring process. The goal is to break down the large BattleManager class (2000+ lines) into smaller, more focused components while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Created
Created new directory structure for modular components:
- `js/battle_logic/core/` - Core battle flow and initialization
- `js/battle_logic/status/` - Status effect management
- `js/battle_logic/damage/` - Damage calculation and healing
- `js/battle_logic/abilities/` - Ability processing and targeting
- `js/battle_logic/passives/` - Passive ability management
- `js/battle_logic/events/` - Event handling and battle log

### 2. Component Shell Files Created
Created 14 minimal implementation files with proper export structure:
- **Core**: `BattleFlowController.js`, `BattleInitializer.js`
- **Status**: `StatusEffectManager.js`, `StatusEffectDefinitionLoader.js`
- **Damage**: `DamageCalculator.js`, `HealingProcessor.js`, `TypeEffectivenessCalculator.js`
- **Abilities**: `AbilityProcessor.js`, `ActionGenerator.js`, `TargetingSystem.js`
- **Passives**: `PassiveAbilityManager.js`, `PassiveTriggerTracker.js`
- **Events**: `BattleEventDispatcher.js`, `BattleLogManager.js`

Each file contains:
- A class that encapsulates a specific portion of battle functionality
- Constructor that accepts a reference to the main BattleManager
- Shell method implementations that delegate to the original BattleManager
- Both ES module exports and global window object assignments for compatibility

### 3. BattleManager Toggle Mechanism
Modified `BattleManager.js` to include:
- A toggle flag (`useNewImplementation`) to switch between original and new implementations
- References to all component managers
- Conditional logic in key methods to delegate to new components when toggle is enabled
- Dynamic import of all component classes in the `initialize()` method
- ES module export in addition to global window assignment

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Toggle Implementation Pattern
The toggle pattern follows this structure:
```javascript
methodName() {
    // REFACTORING: Use new implementation if toggle is enabled
    if (this.useNewImplementation && this.componentManager) {
        return this.componentManager.methodName(...arguments);
    }

    // Original implementation
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

#### Component Manager Initialization
The initialization process:
1. Dynamically imports all component classes using ES module imports
2. Instantiates each component with a reference to the BattleManager
3. Establishes relationships between components that need to interact
4. Includes comprehensive error handling with fallback to original implementation

#### Component Template Structure
Each component follows this common pattern:
```javascript
class ComponentName {
    constructor(battleManager) {
        this.battleManager = battleManager;
    }

    methodName(...args) {
        console.log("[ComponentName] methodName called - SHELL IMPLEMENTATION");
        return this.battleManager.methodName(...args);
    }
}

// Export for ES modules
export default ComponentName;

// Also make available as a global for compatibility
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.ComponentName = ComponentName;
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Module Loading Strategy
- Uses ES dynamic imports to avoid circular dependencies
- Maintains global window object assignments for backward compatibility
- Provides graceful fallback if module loading fails

### Error Handling
- Multiple layers of error handling during initialization
- Automatic fallback to original implementation if any errors occur
- Detailed console logging for diagnostic purposes

### Export Compatibility
- Each component provides both ES module exports and global window assignments
- BattleManager.js updated to have proper ES module export

### Execution Path
- Default path still uses original implementation (toggle is off)
- New components are initialized but only used if toggle is enabled
- Each method checks toggle before deciding which implementation to use

## Testing Notes
To test this implementation:
1. Verify the game works normally with `useNewImplementation = false` (default)
2. The toggle can be enabled in browser console for testing with:
   ```
   window.battleManager.useNewImplementation = true;
   ```
3. Important: The toggle should revert to false if any initialization errors occur

## Next Steps (Stage 2)
1. Implement full functionality in StatusEffectManager and StatusEffectDefinitionLoader
2. Add conditional code in BattleManager to toggle between implementations for status effect methods
3. Test status effect application with toggle on/off
