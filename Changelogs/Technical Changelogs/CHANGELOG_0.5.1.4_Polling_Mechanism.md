# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Scene Loading Polling Mechanism

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a race condition that occurs when trying to start the battle. It implements a polling mechanism to ensure the Phaser BattleScene is fully registered and ready before attempting to start it, solving the "BattleScene class not available" error.

## Issues Fixed

### Battle Start Race Condition
- Fixed: "BattleScene class not available when trying to start battle!" error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js
- Fixed: Scene starting before it's fully registered with Phaser's scene manager
- Fixed: Battle UI not appearing due to premature scene start attempts

## Implementation Details

### TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js Modifications
- Added `checkSceneReadyAndStart` function to poll for scene readiness
- Implemented timeout-based retries to check if the scene is available
- Added proper error handling and UI state recovery for failed attempts
- Enhanced debug logging throughout the scene starting process

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Uses a polling approach with setTimeout to periodically check scene availability
- Performs dual verification of scene readiness:
  1. Checks if `window.game.scene.getScene('BattleScene')` returns a valid instance
  2. Verifies the scene key exists in `window.game.scene.keys`
- Includes maximum retry limit (20 attempts) to prevent infinite loops
- Provides detailed debug logs to trace the scene loading process
- Gracefully reverts UI state if the scene fails to load after multiple attempts

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was a timing issue that manifested after converting BattleScene to an ES module. Because ES modules load differently than traditional scripts, the BattleScene class definition wasn't immediately available when the "Start Battle" button was clicked. The application would attempt to start the scene before it was fully registered with Phaser's scene manager.

This fix addresses the issue by implementing a polling mechanism that waits for the scene to be fully registered before attempting to start it, rather than assuming it's immediately available. This handles the asynchronous nature of ES module loading while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
