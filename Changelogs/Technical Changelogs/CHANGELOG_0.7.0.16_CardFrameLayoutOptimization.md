# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.16 - Card Frame Layout Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The card frame layout had two key issues that limited the visibility of character artwork:

1. **Health Bar Positioning**: The health bar was positioned at the center-bottom (`healthBarOffsetY: 90`) of the card, taking up valuable space in the middle of the character art.

2. **Nameplate Height and Positioning**: The nameplate was too tall (`nameBannerHeight: 40px`) and positioned too high in the card (`nameOffsetY: 110`), causing it to overlap with the bottom portion of character artwork. This was particularly noticeable in full-body character art like Nyria and Sylvanna shown in the examples.

These positioning issues resulted in character artwork being partially obscured by UI elements, reducing the visual impact and clarity of character representations.

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved repositioning both elements to maximize the visible art area:

1. **Health Bar Repositioning**:
   - Moved the health bar from below the center to the top of the card
   - Changed `healthBarOffsetY` from 90 to -148 (positioning it near the top edge)

2. **Nameplate Adjustments**:
   - Repositioned the nameplate to be flush with the bottom edge of the card
   - Changed `nameOffsetY` from 110 to 135
   - Reduced nameplate height from 40px to 25px to be more space-efficient

### Code Changes

```javascript
// Health display - Changed values
healthBarOffsetY: -148,  // Previously 90 - moved from below center to top of card

// Nameplate - Changed values
nameBannerHeight: 25,    // Previously 40 - reduced height
nameOffsetY: 135,        // Previously 110 - moved closer to bottom edge
```

## Visual Improvements

This layout optimization yields several key improvements:

1. **Maximized Art Display**: More of the character art is visible without UI element overlaps
2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Health at top and name at bottom creates a natural framing for the character art
3. **Consistent with Card Game Standards**: Matches common layouts in digital card games where stats are at the top and identification at the bottom
4. **Better Visual Balance**: Health and name elements now have clear dedicated spaces rather than competing with the main artwork

## Card Layout Calculation Details

The optimized positioning was calculated based on the card dimensions:

- **Card Height**: 320px (total height, with center at 0)
- **Card Frame**: 10px border width
- **Visible Area**: ~300px height for content

For the health bar:
- Positioned at -148px from center (near top of card)
- With card height of 320px, this places it ~12px from the top edge

For the nameplate:
- Reduced height to 25px (from 40px)
- Positioned at 135px from center
- With card height of 320px and nameplate height of 25px, this places it flush with the bottom edge of the card (center of nameplate ~22.5px from bottom edge)

## Testing Results

Cards now display character art more prominently with UI elements properly positioned at the top and bottom edges. Names are clearly legible without overlapping artwork, and health bars are visible at a glance at the top of each card.

## Next Steps

While this change significantly improves the card layout, a few additional enhancements could be considered in the future:

1. **Dynamic Health Bar**: The health bar could be made even more compact or transparent when at full health
2. **Text Styling**: Further nameplate text improvements could enhance readability on all card types
3. **Card Boundaries**: With UI elements now at the edges, consider adding subtle padding to prevent elements from appearing too close to the card border
