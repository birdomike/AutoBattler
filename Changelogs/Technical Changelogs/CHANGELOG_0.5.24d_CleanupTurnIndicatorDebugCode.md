# CHANGELOG 0.5.24d: Cleanup of Turn Indicator Debug Code

## Issue Description
After successfully resolving the turn indicator issue in version 0.5.24c, our code was left with numerous temporary diagnostic `console.log` and `console.warn` statements that were specifically added to debug the turn indicator functionality. These logs were creating console clutter during normal operation and were no longer needed.

## Implementation Approach
Perform a systematic cleanup of all temporary debug logging code added for the turn indicator debugging in version 0.5.24b. This cleanup focused on removing only the diagnostic logging statements, while preserving all functional code and essential error handling.

## Changes

### 1. BattleScene.js
- Removed enhanced logging in the `TURN_STARTED` event listener:
  - Removed verbose event data logging with "TURN_STARTED Event Received" messages
  - Preserved the core event handler call
- Removed diagnostic logs inside `handleTurnStarted` method:
  - Removed "handleTurnStarted CALLED" and event data dumps
  - Removed TurnIndicator creation logging statements
  - Removed fallback graphics indicator creation logs
  - Preserved all actual functionality including error handling

### 2. TeamContainer.js
- Removed diagnostic logs from `clearTurnIndicators` method:
  - Removed "clearTurnIndicators called for team" entry logging
  - Removed per-sprite unhighlight logging
  - Removed summary log at the end
  - Preserved actual unhighlighting code with safety checks
- Removed diagnostic logs from `showTurnIndicator` method:
  - Removed call tracking logs
  - Removed sprite lookup success/failure logging
  - Preserved actual indicator showing functionality
- Removed diagnostic logs from `getCharacterSpriteByName` method:
  - Removed character lookup logging
  - Removed "available characters" listing with iterative logging
  - Removed found/not found result logs
  - Preserved actual sprite lookup functionality

### 3. CharacterSprite.js
- Removed diagnostic logs from `highlight` method:
  - Removed "highlight called for" tracking logs
  - Preserved warning for missing scene/container
  - Kept all actual highlighting code
- Removed diagnostic logs from `unhighlight` method:
  - Removed "unhighlight called for" logs
  - Preserved error handling and actual unhighlighting code

## Impact
- Console output is now much cleaner during battles
- Essential error handling and warnings are maintained
- No change to actual turn indicator functionality
- Better performance due to reduced console operations

## Notes for Future Reference
When debugging complex UI interactions like the turn indicator:
1. Add temporary debugging code with clear "TEMPORARY" comments
2. After resolving the issue, create a dedicated cleanup task
3. Use systematic approach to ensure all temporary diagnostics are removed
4. Preserve essential error handling and warnings

The turn indicator now properly follows the character currently taking action, and the console is free from debug clutter, making it easier to spot actual issues during development.
