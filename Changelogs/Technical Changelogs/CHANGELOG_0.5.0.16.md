# Changelog: v0.5.0.16 - Battle Log Performance Optimization

## DirectBattleLog.js Improvements
* **Removed Timestamps**: Eliminated timestamps from battle log messages for cleaner display
* **Improved Processing Speed**: Reduced base message processing speed from 800ms to 200ms for more responsive message display
* **Enhanced Backlog Detection**:
  * Reduced backlog detection threshold from 5 to 3 messages
  * Increased maximum backlog scaling factor from 3x to 5x
  * Lowered minimum processing time from 150ms to 50ms during heavy backlogs
* **Battle Speed Synchronization**: Adjusted base speed in the battle speed synchronization method to match new defaults

## Performance Benefits
* **Faster Message Processing**: Messages appear more quickly, reducing lag between game events and log display
* **Better Backlog Handling**: More aggressive clearing of message backlogs when they occur
* **Cleaner Display**: Removal of timestamps creates a more streamlined, focused battle log
* **Improved Responsiveness**: Battle log now reacts more quickly to game state changes like pausing

These changes significantly improve the battle log's ability to keep up with combat flow while maintaining readability and not sacrificing the player's ability to follow what's happening in combat.
