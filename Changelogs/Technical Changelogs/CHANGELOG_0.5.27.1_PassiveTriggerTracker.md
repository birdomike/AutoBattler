# CHANGELOG 0.5.27.1 - PassiveTriggerTracker Implementation

## Overview
This update implements the PassiveTriggerTracker component as part of Stage 6 of the BattleManager refactoring plan. The PassiveTriggerTracker extracts passive ability trigger tracking from the monolithic BattleManager, providing a dedicated component for managing passive ability trigger state and history.

## Technical Changes

### 1. Created PassiveTriggerTracker Component
- Created new component at `js/battle_logic/passives/PassiveTriggerTracker.js`
- Extracted and implemented core tracking methods:
  - `recordTrigger(character, passiveId, trigger)`: Record a passive trigger occurrence
  - `hasFiredThisTurn(character, passiveId, trigger)`: Check if a passive has triggered this turn
  - `hasFiredThisBattle(character, passiveId, trigger)`: Check if a passive has triggered this battle
  - `resetTurnTracking()`: Reset per-turn tracking at the start of each turn
  - `resetBattleTracking()`: Reset battle-wide tracking at the start of each battle
  - `getMaxStacksForPassive(ability)`: Get the maximum number of times a passive can trigger

### 2. Updated Script Loading in index.html
- Added PassiveTriggerTracker script tag in index.html before BattleManager
- Added proper load order comment: "Must load before BattleManager"
- Placed after AbilityProcessor to maintain organized dependency loading

### 3. Updated BattleManager Initialization
- Added PassiveTriggerTracker initialization in `initializeComponentManagers()`
- Added verification logging for PassiveTriggerTracker methods
- Updated `useNewImplementation` flag to include PassiveTriggerTracker availability

### 4. Added Reset Triggers in Battle Flow
- Added call to `resetTurnTracking()` at the start of each turn in BattleManager's `startNextTurn()`
- Added call to `resetBattleTracking()` at the start of a new battle in BattleManager's `startBattle()`

### 5. Added Toggle Mechanism for Passive Trigger Tracking
- Updated `processPassiveAbilities()` method to use PassiveTriggerTracker when toggle is enabled
- Added conditional logic to check and record triggers through the component
- Maintained original implementation code for backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Design
The PassiveTriggerTracker uses two primary data structures:
- `turnTriggers`: A Map that tracks triggering within the current turn (Map<triggerKey, boolean>)
- `battleTriggers`: A Map that counts triggers across the entire battle (Map<triggerKey, count>)

### Key Generation Approach
- Created a robust `_generateTriggerKey(character, passiveId, trigger)` method
- Handles both character objects and character IDs for flexible integration
- Creates consistent keys for reliable trigger tracking

### Error Handling
Added defensive programming throughout:
- Parameter validation in all public methods
- Error handling with sensible defaults for invalid parameters
- Detailed warning messages when invalid data is provided

### Advanced Tracking Features
Implemented additional utility methods:
- `getTriggerCount()`: Get the number of times a passive has triggered
- `hasReachedMaxStacks()`: Check if a passive has reached its maximum trigger count
- `getMaxStacksForPassive()`: Extract max triggers setting from ability configuration

### Testing Notes
This implementation supports feature toggling for A/B testing:
1. Toggle can be enabled/disabled via `battleManager.toggleImplementation()`
2. When enabled, the new PassiveTriggerTracker handles all passive trigger tracking
3. When disabled, the original character-level tracking is used

## Next Steps
- Complete verification and testing
- Clean up original tracking code in BattleManager.js (v0.5.27.1_Cleanup)
- Proceed to PassiveAbilityManager implementation (v0.5.27.2)
