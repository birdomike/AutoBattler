# Technical Changelog 0.6.3.1 - Fixed Circular JSON Error in Diagnostics

## Overview

This update fixes a critical bug in the diagnostic logging system that was preventing the BattleEventManager from initializing properly. The bug occurred due to circular references in objects that were being passed to JSON.stringify() during logging, causing the system to crash before event listeners could be registered.

## Root Cause

During battle initialization, when BattleBridge dispatches the `BATTLE_INITIALIZED` event, the event data contains circular references to both `battleManager` and `battleScene`. This data was being passed through `JSON.stringify()` in the diagnostic logs, causing a `TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON` that prevented further code execution.

Since this error happened during BattleScene initialization and before BattleEventManager was created, it prevented action indicators and turn highlighting from working.

## Implementation Details

### BattleBridge.js Changes

- Modified the diagnostic logging in the `dispatchEvent` method to safely handle circular references:
  - Replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data || {}))` with safer logging approach
  - Now logs the object keys and the raw data object, which browser consoles can handle safely

```javascript
// Changed from:
console.log('[BB dispatchEvent CALLED] EventType:', eventType, 'Data:', JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data || {})));

// To:
console.log('[BB dispatchEvent CALLED] EventType:', eventType, 'Data Keys:', data ? Object.keys(data) : 'No data', 'Raw Data (beware circular):', data);
```

### BattleEventManager.js Changes

- Added explicit initialization log to verify when the component is being created:
  - Added log at the start of the `initialize()` method to track execution flow
  - Verified that constructor diagnostic logs were properly in place

```javascript
// Added to the beginning of initialize() method:
console.log('[BEM initialize] === INITIALIZE START === BattleEventManager initializing listeners. BattleBridge available:', !!this.battleBridge);
```

## Technical Impact

This change allows the initialization flow to complete successfully, which enables:

1. Proper creation of the BattleEventManager instance
2. Registration of event listeners for CHARACTER_ACTION and ABILITY_USED events
3. Successful processing of these events by their respective handlers
4. Proper display of visual indicators (turn highlighting and action text)

## Testing Approach

The fix was validated by:
1. Verifying that no TypeError occurred during battle initialization
2. Confirming that BattleEventManager constructor and initialization logs appeared in the console
3. Checking that event listeners were successfully registered
4. Observing action indicators and turn highlighting working correctly during battle

## Next Steps

Once the battle visual indicators are confirmed to be working correctly, the diagnostic logs marked with "TEMP DIAGNOSTIC - DELETE AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING" should be removed, as they are not intended for production code.
