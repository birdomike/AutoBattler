## Hotfix for Battle System: Message Forwarding Fix

### Issue
A syntax error was introduced in the BattleManager.js file during the update to version 0.5.0.14, causing the battle system to fail to load entirely. The error occurred in the logMessage method where incomplete edits caused a syntax breakdown.

### Fix
- **Corrected logMessage Method**: Fixed the syntax error in BattleManager.js that was preventing the game from loading
- **Properly Implemented Event Forwarding**: Ensured that all battle log messages are properly forwarded to the Phaser battle log
- **Added Error Handling**: Improved error recovery to prevent similar issues in the future

### Technical Approach
The hotfix specifically:
1. Repaired the logMessage method in BattleManager.js to properly forward battle events
2. Fixed the integration between BattleManager and BattleBridge event system
3. Corrected the implementation of type effectiveness messaging

This hotfix preserves all the functionality intended for version 0.5.0.14 while resolving the critical loading issue.

### Implementation Note
The error was detected early and fixed before it could impact players' progression. No game data was affected by this issue.
