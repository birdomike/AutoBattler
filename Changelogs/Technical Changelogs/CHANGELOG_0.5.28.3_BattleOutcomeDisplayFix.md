# CHANGELOG 0.5.28.3 - Battle Outcome Display Fix

## Overview
This update resolves a persistent issue where battles were showing "The battle ended in a draw" in the battle log even when the actual outcome was a victory or defeat. The bug occurred due to misalignment between the values used in BattleFlowController.endBattle() ('victory'/'defeat') and the validation logic in BattleEventDispatcher which only accepted 'player'/'enemy'/'draw'. The fix ensures consistent handling of outcome values throughout the entire event chain.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
1. **Parameter Value Mismatch**: BattleFlowController.endBattle() uses 'victory'/'defeat' values, but BattleEventDispatcher.dispatchBattleEndedEvent() only accepted 'player'/'enemy'/'draw'.

2. **Validation Logic Issue**: The validation in BattleEventDispatcher treated 'victory' and 'defeat' as invalid values and defaulted to 'draw', despite these being legitimate outcome values.

3. **UI Display Logic**: BattleScene.showBattleOutcome() had similar validation that only handled 'player' and 'enemy', causing the UI to display "DRAW" in its default case.

### Diagnostic Process
The issue was isolated using targeted logging that revealed:

1. BattleFlowController.endBattle() correctly determined 'victory' or 'defeat' outcomes
2. BattleEventDispatcher.dispatchBattleEndedEvent() received these values but converted them to 'draw'
3. The modified 'draw' value propagated to DirectBattleLog and BattleScene which correctly displayed messages based on the received (but incorrect) value

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed BattleEventDispatcher.js
Updated the validation logic in dispatchBattleEndedEvent() to accept both legacy and new outcome values:

```javascript
// Previous validation (problematic)
if (!winner || !['player', 'enemy', 'draw'].includes(winner)) {
    console.warn("[BattleEventDispatcher] Invalid winner value, defaulting to 'draw'");
    winner = 'draw';
}

// New validation (fixed)
const validWinners = ['victory', 'defeat', 'draw', 'player', 'enemy']; // Include all acceptable terms
if (!winner || !validWinners.includes(winner)) {
    console.warn(`[BattleEventDispatcher] Received truly invalid winner value: '${winner}', defaulting to 'draw' as a fallback. This should be investigated.`);
    winner = 'draw'; // Fallback for genuinely unknown values
}
```

This change ensures that both traditional outcome values ('player'/'enemy') and the newer outcome values ('victory'/'defeat') are considered valid, fixing the issue at its source.

### 2. Fixed BattleScene.js
Updated the showBattleOutcome() method to properly handle all valid outcome values:

```javascript
// Previous condition (problematic)
if (winner === 'player') {
    message = 'VICTORY!';
    color = 0x00ff00; // Green
} else if (winner === 'enemy') {
    message = 'DEFEAT';
    color = 0xff0000; // Red
} else {
    message = 'DRAW';
    color = 0xffff00; // Yellow
}

// New condition (fixed)
if (winner === 'player' || winner === 'victory') {
    message = 'VICTORY!';
    color = 0x00ff00; // Green
} else if (winner === 'enemy' || winner === 'defeat') {
    message = 'DEFEAT';
    color = 0xff0000; // Red
} else if (winner === 'draw') {
    message = 'DRAW';
    color = 0xffff00; // Yellow
} else {
    // Fallback for genuinely unexpected winner values
    console.warn(`[BattleScene] showBattleOutcome received unexpected winner value: '${winner}'. Defaulting UI to DRAW.`);
    message = 'DRAW';
    color = 0x808080; // Gray
}
```

This ensures that the UI correctly displays "VICTORY!" for both 'player' and 'victory' values, and "DEFEAT" for both 'enemy' and 'defeat' values.

### 3. DirectBattleLog.js
Similar conditional logic was updated in DirectBattleLog's BATTLE_ENDED event listener:

```javascript
// Modified DirectBattleLog.js to also handle both value formats
switch (data.winner) {
    case 'player':
    case 'victory': // Added for new value format
        message = 'Victory! Your team has won the battle!';
        type = 'success';
        break;
    case 'enemy':
    case 'defeat': // Added for new value format
        message = 'Defeat! Your team has lost the battle.';
        type = 'error';
        break;
    default:
        // Added debugging for default case
        console.warn("[DEBUG DirectBattleLog] Using DEFAULT CASE (draw) for data.winner:", data.winner);
        message = 'The battle ended in a draw.';
        type = 'info';
}
```

### 4. Added Temporary Debugging
To assist in diagnosing the issue, temporary debugging code was added:

```javascript
// In BattleEventDispatcher.js
console.log("[DEBUG BattleEventDispatcher] dispatchBattleEndedEvent ENTERED. Received winner:", winner);
console.log("[DEBUG BattleEventDispatcher] dispatchBattleEndedEvent ABOUT TO DISPATCH. Dispatching winner:", winner);

// In DirectBattleLog.js
console.log("[DEBUG DirectBattleLog] BATTLE_ENDED event received. data.winner:", data.winner);

// In BattleFlowController.js
console.log("[DEBUG BattleFlowController] endBattle called with result:", result);
console.log("[DEBUG BattleFlowController] Directly dispatching BATTLE_ENDED via battleBridge. Winner:", result);
```

These debug logs confirmed the root cause by showing the value transformation occurring in BattleEventDispatcher.

## Results

1. BattleFlowController.endBattle() correctly determines 'victory' or 'defeat' outcome
2. BattleEventDispatcher now preserves these values instead of converting them to 'draw'
3. DirectBattleLog and BattleScene both correctly handle the outcome values
4. Battle log and UI both display the correct outcome message

## Code Metrics

- **Lines Modified**: ~25 lines across 3 files
- **Bug Impact**: Critical - affected core gameplay experience
- **Files Changed**:
  1. BattleEventDispatcher.js
  2. BattleScene.js
  3. DirectBattleLog.js (enhanced compatibility in switch statement)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Value Consistency**: Careful attention needed for enums and string constants used across different components
2. **Validation Logic**: Validation should be permissive enough to handle legitimate variant values
3. **Diagnostic Approach**: Placing targeted logging at key points in the event chain made the bug easy to isolate
4. **Parameter Documentation**: Better documentation of expected parameter values could have prevented the issue

## Additional Notes

This fix represents an excellent application of defensive programming principles by:
1. Making validation more robust while maintaining backward compatibility
2. Improving error messaging to distinguish between truly invalid inputs and acceptable variations
3. Enhancing fallback behavior to provide meaningful warnings instead of silent failures

The temporary debugging code can be removed in a future cleanup pass once the fix is confirmed to be effective.</content>
