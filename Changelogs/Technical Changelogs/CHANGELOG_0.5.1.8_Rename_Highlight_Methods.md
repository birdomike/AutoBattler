# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.8 - 2025-05-09

## Rename Methods for Turn Indicator System

This update improves clarity in the codebase by renaming methods in the turn indicator system to better reflect their specific purpose, making a cleaner separation between turn indicators and future visual effects systems.

### Renamed Methods

#### 1. TeamContainer.js
**Changed**:
- Renamed `highlightCharacter()` → `showTurnIndicator()`
- Renamed `clearHighlights()` → `clearTurnIndicators()`

**Purpose**: Made the method names more specific to their actual function of showing turn indicators rather than generic "highlights", which creates cleaner separation for future visual effect systems.

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Changed**:
- Updated references to the renamed methods
- Updated comments to reflect new method names
- Updated error message for clarity

### Implementation Details

#### TeamContainer.js Changes

```javascript
// Before
highlightCharacter(identifier) {
    // ... existing code ...
}

// After
showTurnIndicator(identifier) {
    // ... same implementation ...
}

// Before
clearHighlights() {
    // ... existing code ...
    console.log(`TeamContainer clearHighlights: Cleared highlights for all characters in team ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'Player' : 'Enemy'}`);
}

// After
clearTurnIndicators() {
    // ... same implementation ...
    console.log(`TeamContainer clearTurnIndicators: Cleared turn indicators for all characters in team ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'Player' : 'Enemy'}`);
}
```

#### BattleScene.js Changes

```javascript
// Before - in handleTurnStarted method
// Clear any previous highlights
if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
            
// Highlight the active character
teamContainer.highlightCharacter(newActiveCharacter.name);

// After
// Clear any previous turn indicators
if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearTurnIndicators();
if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearTurnIndicators();
            
// Show turn indicator for the active character
teamContainer.showTurnIndicator(newActiveCharacter.name);

// Before - in highlightActiveCharacter method
teamContainer.highlightCharacter(character.name);

// After
teamContainer.showTurnIndicator(character.name);
```

### Technical Approach

The implementation approach maintained all existing functionality while simply updating the method names and references for better clarity. This change was purely nomenclature-focused and didn't alter the actual behavior of the system.

The existing highlighting mechanism (which adds a visual effect to the active character) continues to work the same way, but is now more appropriately named to reflect its specific purpose as a turn indicator system.

### Benefits

1. **Clearer Code Intent**: Method names now explicitly state what they do
2. **Future-Proofing**: Creates separation between turn indicators and future visual effects systems
3. **Better Maintainability**: Makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose of each method
4. **Conceptual Clarity**: Distinguishes between "highlighting" (which could be any visual effect) and the specific "turn indicator" functionality

This change sets the groundwork for implementing additional visual effect systems in the future without naming conflicts or confusion.
