# CHANGELOG 0.7.7.7 - Drakarion's Restore Wounds Sound Implementation

## Overview
This update implements ability-specific sound for Drakarion's Restore Wounds ability, a self-healing ability that fits Drakarion's fire-themed character. By adding the appropriate mapping to AudioAssetMappings.js, this ability now plays its unique sound effect when cast in battle. This continues our systematic implementation of ability sounds, focusing on healing/support abilities that were previously using fallback sounds.

## Implementation Solution

### Added Sound Mapping to AudioAssetMappings.js

**File**: `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\js\data\AudioAssetMappings.js`
**Section**: `abilities` (Tier 1 sound mappings)

Added new ability mapping for Drakarion's healing ability:
```javascript
'drakarion_restore_wounds': {
  cast: {
    path: 'ability_specific/Drakarion/Restore_Wounds.mp3',
    variations: false
  }
}
```

This configuration follows the established Tier 1 (ability-specific) pattern used for other character abilities, ensuring the sound will be properly resolved through the 4-tier hierarchical system.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sound File
- **File Location**: `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\assets\audio\InCombat_Sounds\ability_specific\Drakarion\Restore_Wounds.mp3`
- **Sound Type**: Fire-themed healing ability cast effect
- **Event Type**: `cast` (for when the ability is initially cast)
- **Ability Function**: Self-healing with fire/restoration theme

### Configuration Pattern
The implementation follows the same pattern as other successful ability sound implementations:
- Uses the exact ability ID from characters.json: `drakarion_restore_wounds`
- Follows the established path structure for ability-specific sounds
- Uses the same event type (`cast`) for ability activation
- Maintains the non-variation approach for consistency

### Audio Resolution Path
When this ability is cast, the sound system follows this resolution path:
1. SoundEventHandler receives CHARACTER_ACTION event with `abilityId: "drakarion_restore_wounds"`
2. SoundEventHandler calls AudioAssetMappings.helpers.getAbilitySound() with the ability ID and 'cast' event
3. Tier 1 resolution finds the direct mapping in AudioAssetMappings.abilities
4. BattleSoundManager plays the sound with the generated key

## Thematic Consistency

This implementation enhances Drakarion's sound profile by providing a unique audio signature for his healing ability. The sound effect conveys the warm, restorative nature of the ability while maintaining consistency with Drakarion's fire theme. This creates an appropriate contrast with his offensive Flame Strike ability, providing audio cues that help players distinguish between Drakarion's different abilities.

## Benefits of Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Character Audio Profile
- Expands Drakarion's audio profile beyond just his offensive abilities
- Creates a distinctive audio signature for his healing capability
- Reinforces the character's fire theme through audio design

### 2. Increased Ability Sound Coverage
- Brings the total implemented ability sounds to 10 out of 16
- Completes 2/2 of Drakarion's active abilities
- Makes progress on support/healing ability coverage

### 3. Improved Player Experience
- Creates clear audio differentiation between attack and healing abilities
- Provides immediate audio feedback when the healing ability is used
- Enhances overall game feel through consistent audio design

## Testing Verification

During testing, the implementation shows successful sound playback with the following console logs:

```
[SoundAssetLoader] Found ability: drakarion_restore_wounds for event: cast
[SoundEventHandler] Extracted abilityId for sound lookup: 'drakarion_restore_wounds'
[SoundEventHandler] ✅ Found Tier 1 ability sound for drakarion_restore_wounds.cast
[BattleSoundManager] ✅ Playing ability sound: ability_specific_drakarion_restore_wounds_mp3
```

## Remaining Abilities

With this implementation, six abilities still need sound implementation:
1. Aqualia's Ice Shield - Defensive shield ability
2. Aqualia's Frost Chain - Multi-target attack with slow
3. Vaelgor's Void Barrier - Defensive barrier ability
4. Lumina's Holy Smite - Offensive light ability
5. Lumina's Divine Light - AoE ability affecting all characters
6. Zephyr's Evasive Maneuver - Utility evade ability

## Final Verification

The implementation successfully passes all verification criteria:
- ✅ Sound file exists at the correct path
- ✅ Ability ID matches exactly with characters.json
- ✅ AudioAssetMappings.js entry follows established patterns
- ✅ Sound plays correctly during gameplay
- ✅ Console logs confirm proper Tier 1 resolution
- ✅ No errors or warnings appear during sound playback
