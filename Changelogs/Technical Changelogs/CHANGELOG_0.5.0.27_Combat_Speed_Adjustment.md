# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.27_Combat_Speed_Adjustment.md

## Overview
This update slows down the pace of combat by 100% across all speed settings. The goal is to make battles more methodical and give players more time to observe each action and its results, improving the overall gameplay experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Adjusting Base Timing Values in BattleManager Constructor
Modified the default timing values in BattleManager.js constructor:

```diff
-        this.turnDelay = 3000; // Delay between turns (ms)
-        this.actionDelay = 1600; // Delay between actions (ms)
+        this.turnDelay = 6000; // Delay between turns (ms) - doubled from 3000ms for slower pace
+        this.actionDelay = 3200; // Delay between actions (ms) - doubled from 1600ms for slower pace
```

These changes double the base time between turns and actions, creating a more deliberate pace for the combat.

### 2. Updating the setSpeed Method

The setSpeed method in BattleManager.js was also modified to use the new doubled base values when calculating adjustments for different speed settings:

```diff
-            // Base timing values
-            const BASE_TURN_DELAY = 3000;
-            const BASE_ACTION_DELAY = 1600;
+            // Base timing values - doubled from original values for slower pace
+            const BASE_TURN_DELAY = 6000;
+            const BASE_ACTION_DELAY = 3200;
```

This ensures that the speed multiplier options (1x, 2x, 3x) maintain the same relative relationship to each other, just at a slower overall pace.

## Testing and Verification

Testing confirmed that the changes successfully slow down the combat pace while maintaining proper operation of all battle systems:

1. **Battle Log Integration**: The battle log continues to display messages properly with the new timing, with no message overlap or out-of-sequence issues.

2. **Animation Synchronization**: Attack animations and character movements remain properly synchronized with the action timing.

3. **Speed Control Functionality**: The speed controls (1x, 2x, 3x) continue to function as expected, with proper relative speed differences between settings.

4. **Turn Progression**: Turn-based progress flows correctly with the new timing values, with no unexpected pauses or delays.

## User Experience Impact

This change significantly improves the battle viewing experience:

1. **Improved Readability**: Players have more time to read battle log messages before the next action occurs.

2. **Better Visual Tracking**: The slower pace makes it easier to follow which character is acting and what effects are being applied.

3. **Enhanced Strategy**: Players can better observe the results of abilities and status effects, enhancing the strategic elements of the game.

4. **Accessibility Improvement**: The slower pace makes the game more accessible to players who might have difficulty processing rapid visual information.

## Technical Notes

1. The implementation maintains the same code structure, only changing timing values.

2. No changes were needed to UI components, as they respond to the same events, just with different timing.

3. The speed multiplier system continues to function as designed, allowing players to adjust the pace to their preference while maintaining the overall slower base timing.

4. All event sequencing is preserved, ensuring that game logic remains consistent despite the timing changes.
