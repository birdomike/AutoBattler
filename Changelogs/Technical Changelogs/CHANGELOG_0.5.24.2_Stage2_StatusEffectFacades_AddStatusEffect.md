# Version 0.5.24.2: Stage 2 - Converting Status Effect Methods to Facades

## Change Summary
Converted the `addStatusEffect` method in BattleManager.js to a thin facade that delegates to StatusEffectManager. This continues the refactoring of BattleManager into a pure coordination layer by moving specialized functionality to dedicated components.

## Technical Details

### 1. Change Analysis
The original `addStatusEffect` method was ~90 lines of complex logic that included:
- Logic for effect stacking
- Duration calculations
- Team-specific logging
- Status icon updating

The new facade method is only 8 lines and simply delegates to the specialized StatusEffectManager component.

### 2. Changes Made

#### 2.1 Method Signature Unchanged
```javascript
addStatusEffect(character, statusId, duration, value)
```

The method's signature remained identical to maintain backward compatibility with all existing code that calls this method.

#### 2.2 Implementation Changed
Before:
```javascript
addStatusEffect(character, statusId, duration, value) {
    // REFACTORING: Use new implementation if toggle is enabled
    if (this.useNewImplementation && this.statusEffectManager) {
        return this.statusEffectManager.addStatusEffect(character, statusId, null, duration, 1);
    }
    
    // Original implementation
    // 80+ lines of implementation logic...
}
```

After:
```javascript
addStatusEffect(character, statusId, duration, value) {
    // Defensive check
    if (!this.statusEffectManager) {
        console.error("StatusEffectManager not initialized! Cannot add status effect.");
        return false;
    }
    
    // Direct delegation
    return this.statusEffectManager.addStatusEffect(character, statusId, null, duration, 1);
}
```

### 3. Risk Assessment and Testing

#### 3.1 Risk Factors
- **Parameter Mapping**: The StatusEffectManager.addStatusEffect method requires a `source` parameter (third position) that the BattleManager method doesn't have. Set to `null`.
- **Return Value**: The facade now properly returns a boolean as specified in the JSDoc.
- **Defensive Handling**: Added proper error handling if StatusEffectManager is not initialized.

#### 3.2 Testing Strategy
- Test adding various status effects in battle (burn, regen, stun, etc.) to verify functionality is preserved
- Verify status effect icons appear correctly on characters
- Test stacking behaviors for stackable effects
- Test duration refreshing on non-stackable effects
- Confirm proper team identifiers are used in log messages

### 4. Results
- Successfully removed approximately 80 lines of code from BattleManager.js
- Maintained identical functionality for status effect application
- Improved separation of concerns by moving status effect logic to StatusEffectManager
- Added proper defensive error handling for component initialization issues
