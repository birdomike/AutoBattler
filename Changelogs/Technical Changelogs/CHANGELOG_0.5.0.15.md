# Changelog: v0.5.0.15 - Battle Log Speed Control Enhancement

## BattleBridge.js Changes
* Added proper `setBattleSpeed()` method that correctly calls `setSpeed()` on BattleManager
* Enhanced `requestSpeedChange()` method to report success status
* Fixed critical issue where BattleBridge was trying to call a non-existent method

## DirectBattleLog.js Changes
* Implemented message queue system for controlled message display
* Added pause/resume toggle button for user control over message flow
* Added battle speed synchronization through `syncWithBattleSpeed()` method
* Implemented adaptive speed adjustment based on message backlog
* Added subtle animation for new messages to improve visibility
* Enhanced message rendering with optimized container handling

## BattleManager.js Changes
* Enhanced `setSpeed()` method to modify timing values based on multiplier
* Added proper notification to UI components via BattleBridge
* Updated speed multiplier options from [1, 2, 4] to [1, 2, 3] to match UI options
* Added tracking of previous speed to avoid redundant notifications

## Key Features
* **User Control**: Added pause/play button for the battle log
* **Visual Feedback**: Subtle animation helps distinguish new messages
* **Adaptive Speed**: Battle log processing speed adjusts based on game speed
* **Backlog Handling**: Message processing accelerates when backlog detected
* **Synchronized Timing**: All speed-dependent systems stay in sync

This implementation fixes the critical issue in the speed control system while creating a more readable and user-friendly battle log that properly keeps pace with the game.
