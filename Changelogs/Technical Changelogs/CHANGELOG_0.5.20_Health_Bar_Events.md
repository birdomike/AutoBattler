# CHANGELOG 0.5.20 - Health Bar Visual Updates

## Issue Description
Following the successful refactoring of battle flow control from BattleManager to BattleFlowController, a visual issue was identified where damage and healing were properly calculated and logged to the battle log, but the health bars in the Phaser UI were not visually updating to reflect these changes. This disconnect between the game state and its visual representation made it difficult for players to track character health during battles.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `applyActionEffect` method in BattleFlowController.js. While this method was successfully calculating and applying health changes to character objects, it was not dispatching the necessary events (`CHARACTER_DAMAGED` and `CHARACTER_HEALED`) via BattleBridge that the Phaser UI components rely on to update health bar visuals.

During the refactoring process, the responsibility for health calculation was moved from BattleManager to BattleFlowController, but the event dispatching code that previously existed in BattleManager was not migrated to the new component.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added CHARACTER_HEALED Event Dispatch
Added code to dispatch the healing event after character healing is calculated:

```javascript
// Dispatch CHARACTER_HEALED event via BattleBridge
if (window.battleBridge && actualHealing > 0) {
    try {
        console.log(`[BattleFlowController] Dispatching CHARACTER_HEALED event for ${action.target.name}`);
        window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_HEALED, {
            character: action.target,
            target: action.target,
            newHealth: action.target.currentHp,
            maxHealth: action.target.stats.hp,
            amount: actualHealing,
            source: action.actor,
            ability: action.ability
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching CHARACTER_HEALED event:', error);
    }
}
```

### 2. Added CHARACTER_DAMAGED Event Dispatch
Added code to dispatch the damage event after character damage is calculated:

```javascript
// Dispatch CHARACTER_DAMAGED event via BattleBridge
if (window.battleBridge && actualDamage > 0) {
    try {
        console.log(`[BattleFlowController] Dispatching CHARACTER_DAMAGED event for ${action.target.name}`);
        window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
            character: action.target,
            target: action.target,
            newHealth: action.target.currentHp,
            maxHealth: action.target.stats.hp,
            amount: actualDamage,
            source: action.actor,
            ability: action.ability
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching CHARACTER_DAMAGED event:', error);
    }
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Event Data
For both event types, the dispatched event data includes:
- `character`: The character that was damaged/healed (for backward compatibility)
- `target`: The target of the damage/healing (same as character for clarity)
- `newHealth`: The current health after damage/healing
- `maxHealth`: The maximum health of the character
- `amount`: The actual amount of damage/healing applied
- `source`: The character that caused the damage/healing
- `ability`: The ability that was used (if applicable)

### 4. Error Handling
Added robust error handling with try/catch blocks and detailed error logging to ensure that if event dispatching fails, it doesn't interrupt the battle flow.

### 5. Optimization
Added conditional checks to only dispatch events when there was actual damage/healing (amount > 0) to avoid unnecessary events.

## Results & Benefits
- Health bars now properly update in real-time during battles
- Players can visually track character health without relying solely on battle log text
- The Phaser UI components receive the necessary update events to animate health changes
- Comprehensive event data enables more sophisticated visual effects (future enhancement)
- More consistent player experience with visual feedback matching the actual game state

## Next Steps
With the health bar updates working, future improvements could include:
1. Enhanced visual effects for different damage types (critical hits, elemental damage)
2. Visual indicators for healing effects beyond just the health bar updates
3. Animation improvements to make health changes more noticeable to players
