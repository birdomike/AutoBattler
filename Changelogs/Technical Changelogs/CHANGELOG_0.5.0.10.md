# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10 - UI Mode Separation & Team Data Fix

## Overview
This update focuses on two critical foundation issues:
1. Separating the DOM-based UI and Phaser-based UI to ensure only one UI system is active at a time
2. Fixing team data processing to ensure player and enemy teams are properly copied and displayed in battle

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Mode Separation

#### Problem
The battle system was initializing both UI systems (DOM-based `BattleUI` and Phaser-based `BattleScene`) simultaneously, causing conflicts and redundant processing.

#### Solution
- Added a `uiMode` flag to BattleManager with possible values: "dom" or "phaser"
- Modified `BattleManager.startBattle()` to check this flag before initializing the DOM-based UI
- Updated `BattleBridge.initialize()` to set `battleManager.uiMode = "phaser"` when initialized
- Added detailed logging to track which UI mode is active during battle initialization

#### Code Changes
- Added `this.uiMode = "dom";` property in `BattleManager` constructor
- Updated the UI initialization check in `startBattle()` to respect the `uiMode` setting
- Modified `BattleBridge.initialize()` to set the `uiMode` to "phaser"

### 2. Team Data Processing Fix

#### Problem
The battle system was showing 0 heroes in battle logs despite teams being visible in Phaser. This was caused by:
- Improper reference handling between TeamManager, BattleManager, and BattleScene
- Lack of proper validation for team data during preparation
- Inconsistent deep copying of team data

#### Solution
- Implemented consistent deep copying of team data using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` 
- Added comprehensive validation for team data at multiple levels
- Added detailed logging at key transfer points to trace data flow
- Fixed the team type detection logic to properly identify player vs. enemy teams
- Implemented null filtering to remove any invalid character entries

#### Code Changes
- Modified `BattleManager.startBattle()` to properly validate and deep copy teams
- Enhanced `prepareTeamForBattle()` with improved validation and team type detection
- Added filtering of null entries in prepared teams
- Added explicit logging of team sizes before and after preparation

## Technical Notes

### Validation Improvements
The update adds several layers of validation:
1. Team array validation to ensure we're working with proper arrays
2. Individual character validation during team preparation
3. Null filtering after team preparation
4. Size comparison checks to verify preparation succeeded

### Logging Enhancements
Added detailed logging to trace team data throughout the process:
- Team size before and after preparation
- Team type detection results
- Character validation failures
- Completion status of team preparation

### Edge Case Handling
- Properly handles empty or undefined team arrays
- Handles null characters within teams
- Provides fallback behavior when validation fails
- Ensures consistent team types with explicit assignment

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with both UI modes to ensure the correct UI is displayed
- Test with various team sizes to verify correct processing
- Test edge cases like empty teams or teams with invalid characters
- Check battle logs to verify team sizes are correctly reported

## Known Limitations
- The fallback team generation for missing enemy teams remains unchanged
- Teams must still be valid JavaScript arrays with proper character objects
- Character objects still need to have valid minimum properties (stats, etc.)
