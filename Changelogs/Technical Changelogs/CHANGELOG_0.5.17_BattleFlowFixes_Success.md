## Version 0.5.17 - 2025-05-19
### Fixed
- **Battle Flow and Check Battle End Fixes**: Resolved critical issues preventing battle progression
  - Fixed null character reference in TURN_STARTED events by reordering action queue generation
  - Fixed "TypeError: char.isDefeated is not a function" by updating to proper property checks
  - Ensured turn highlighting works properly with valid character references
  - Enhanced battle outcome detection with reliable character status checks
  - Confirmed successful fix implementation by verifying battle progresses past first action

### Technical
- **Reordering Logic Fix**:
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE: Determine character first, dispatch event, then generate actions
  const currentChar = this.battleManager.actionQueue?.[0]?.actor || null;
  // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event...
  // ...later in the method...
  this.battleManager.generateTurnActions();
  
  // AFTER: Generate actions first, then determine character, then dispatch event
  this.battleManager.generateTurnActions();
  const currentChar = this.battleManager.actionQueue?.[0]?.actor || null;
  // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event...
  ```

- **Character Status Fix**:
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE: Method call that doesn't exist
  const playerDefeated = this.battleManager.playerTeam.filter(char => char.isDefeated()).length;
  
  // AFTER: Property check using existing properties
  const playerDefeated = this.battleManager.playerTeam.filter(char => char.isDead || char.currentHp <= 0).length;
  ```

### Verification
- Verified both fixes are functioning correctly:
  - The action queue is now populated before determining the current character for TURN_STARTED event
  - The checkBattleEnd method now correctly uses property checks (isDead/currentHp) instead of method calls
  - Both fixes have been confirmed working in the actual game, not just in code review
  - Battle now progresses correctly through multiple actions
