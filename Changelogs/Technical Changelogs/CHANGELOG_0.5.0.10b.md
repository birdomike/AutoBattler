# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10b - Team Data Flow & Battle Outcome Fix

## Overview
This update addresses two critical issues identified in version 0.5.0.10:

1. **Team Data Flow Issue**: Fixed the problem where player team data was being lost when starting a battle via the Battle Control Panel, resulting in "0 heroes vs 3 enemies" in battles.
2. **Battle Completion Issue**: Added a proper battle outcome screen to prevent the quick return to TeamBuilder after battles, allowing players to see their results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Team Data Flow Fix

#### Problem
When initiating battles from the Battle Control Panel, the panel wasn't retrieving the team data from the BattleScene, resulting in `undefined` being passed to BattleManager which then defaulted to empty arrays.

#### Solution
- Modified `BattleBridge.startBattle()` to accept team parameters
- Updated `BattleControlPanel.onStartBattleClicked()` to retrieve team data from its parent scene
- Enhanced `BattleScene.init()` to properly deep copy and store team data
- Added `BattleScene.getTeamData()` utility method for safe team data access
- Implemented proper JSON deep copying at critical handoff points

#### Code Changes
- **BattleBridge.js**: Updated `startBattle()` to accept and forward team parameters
- **BattleControlPanel.js**: 
  - Modified `onStartBattleClicked()` to retrieve team data from scene
  - Added deep copying of team data to prevent reference issues
- **BattleScene.js**:
  - Enhanced `init()` to deep copy and validate team data
  - Added `getTeamData()` utility method

### 2. Battle Outcome Screen

#### Problem
Once a battle concluded, there was no feedback to the user about the result, and the system sometimes returned to TeamBuilder UI immediately.

#### Solution
- Added a `showBattleOutcome()` method to BattleScene
- Connected the method to battle end events via BattleBridge
- Created a visually appealing outcome screen with victory/defeat message
- Added explicit "Return to Team Builder" button for user control
- Ensured the outcome screen persists until user chooses to return

#### Code Changes
- **BattleScene.js**:
  - Added `showBattleOutcome()` method with animation and styling
  - Connected battle end events to the outcome screen
  - Added proper cleanup in `shutdown()`
  - Modified battle bridge event listener for battle end events

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test starting a battle with the Control Panel's "Start Battle" button
2. Verify player team appears correctly in battle (should show all heroes)
3. Let the battle play to completion and verify the outcome screen appears
4. Test both victory and defeat scenarios
5. Verify that returning to TeamBuilder only happens when clicking the return button

## Impact
These changes enhance the player experience by ensuring:
1. Battles always have the correct teams regardless of how they're initiated
2. Players can see the results of their battles before returning to TeamBuilder
3. Users have explicit control over when to return to TeamBuilder

This version builds on the UI Mode separation and team data fixes from 0.5.0.10 to provide a more robust and user-friendly battle experience.
