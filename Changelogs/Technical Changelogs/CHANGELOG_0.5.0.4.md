# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.4 - Basic Character Visualization

## Overview
This update implements the core character visualization system, displaying characters in the Phaser battle scene using their actual character art instead of the placeholder circle pattern. The primary goal was to create a foundation for character representation that can be extended with animations and enhanced visual effects in future updates.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Character Sprite Component
- Created `CharacterSprite.js` component for rendering individual characters
- Implemented character art loading from existing PNG files
- Added colored type-based background circles for visual identification
- Implemented health bar system with dynamic coloring based on remaining health
- Added character name display with team identifier (ally/enemy)
- Implemented basic attack animation system for character interactions

### 2. Team Container Component
- Created `TeamContainer.js` to manage groups of character sprites
- Implemented proper team positioning with player team on left and enemy team on right
- Added dynamic position calculation based on team size
- Created character selection/highlighting functionality
- Implemented helper methods for accessing character sprites by name or index

### 3. Battle Scene Integration
- Updated BattleScene to create and manage character teams
- Implemented the update method to refresh character states
- Added cleanupCharacterTeams method to properly dispose resources
- Created utility methods for:
  - Character highlighting
  - Attack animations
  - Floating text display (for damage, healing, etc.)

### 4. Enhanced Battle Flow Visualization
- Characters can now be highlighted as active during their turn
- Implemented attack animations with proper movement and targeting
- Added floating text system for damage and effect feedback
- Connected to BattleBridge events to accurately display battle progression

## Technical Implementations

### Character Art System
- Uses character art from assets/images/Character Art directory
- Properly positions art based on character data
- Handles art loading with error fallbacks to maintain robustness
- Visual positioning is specific to battle context

### Character Animations
- Implemented movement-based animations for attacks
- Characters move toward their target when attacking
- Clean animation transitions with proper completion callbacks
- Positional awareness for correct character interactions

### Team Organization
- Organized team containers with proper depth management
- Characters are positioned in vertically aligned formations
- Team size is accounted for in positioning calculations
- Player team on left side, enemy team on right side

## Next Steps
- Version 0.5.0.5: Basic Battle Flow Integration
- Version 0.5.0.6: Simple Battle Animations and Effects

## Testing Notes
When testing this version, you should see:
1. Character art properly displayed in their team positions
2. Team organization with player team on left, enemy team on right
3. Character details displayed (name, health)
4. Proper cleanup when returning to Team Builder UI
