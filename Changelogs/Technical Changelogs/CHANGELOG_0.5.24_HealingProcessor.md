# Technical Changelog: Version 0.5.24 - HealingProcessor Implementation

## Overview
This update continues the Stage 4 refactoring of the BattleManager's combat system by extracting healing-related functionality into a dedicated `HealingProcessor` component. This follows the successful pattern established with `TypeEffectivenessCalculator` and `DamageCalculator` extractions, maintaining the same overall architecture and toggle system for gradual implementation.

## Component Design: HealingProcessor
The `HealingProcessor` class is responsible for:
1. Applying healing to characters
2. Managing resurrection logic
3. Dispatching healing-related events
4. Tracking healing results

## Architectural Decisions

### Return Value Structure
The `applyHealing` method returns an object with two fields:
```javascript
{ 
  actualHealing: number,  // Amount of healing actually applied (0 to amount)
  revived: boolean        // Whether character was resurrected
}
```

This structure provides a single return value that contains all necessary information for subsequent processing by the BattleFlowController, particularly for tracking resurrections.

### Resurrection Handling Separation
The `HealingProcessor` implements two separate methods:
1. `applyHealing()` - Handles HP modification and event dispatch
2. `checkAndResetDeathStatus()` - Handles resurrection state management

This separation allows BattleFlowController to manage the order of operations and maintain clear flow control, while ensuring these operations use the same logic.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Component Implementation
`HealingProcessor.js` implements:
- A constructor that takes the BattleManager instance for access to game state and methods
- The `applyHealing` method:
  - Takes target, amount, source, ability, and healType parameters
  - Caps healing at max HP
  - Tracks pre-healing death state for revival detection
  - Dispatches CHARACTER_HEALED events with full context
  - Returns actual healing applied and revival status

- The `checkAndResetDeathStatus` method:
  - Resets character's death state if they have HP > 0
  - Logs resurrection message with team identifier
  - Returns whether resurrection occurred

### 2. Integration with BattleManager
Added a thin facade for `applyHealing` to BattleManager:
- Delegates to HealingProcessor when toggle is enabled
- Maintains original implementation as fallback
- Uses consistent return value structure for compatibility

Updated initialization in `BattleManager.initializeComponentManagers()`:
- Creates HealingProcessor instance
- Adds diagnostic logging for verification
- Updates `useNewImplementation` flag to include HealingProcessor check

### 3. BattleFlowController Integration
Modified `BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()` to:
- Use HealingProcessor for healing when toggle is enabled
- Track both healing amount and revival status
- Use consistent variable naming regardless of implementation
- Properly handle resurrection by delegating to HealingProcessor's checkAndResetDeathStatus

### 4. Error Handling
Added defensive coding to handle edge cases:
- Null target check in applyHealing
- Error handling for CHARACTER_HEALED event dispatch
- Graceful fallback if HealingProcessor is not available

## Technical Debt Mitigation
- Removed debug logs from development shell implementation
- Standardized variable naming between old and new implementations
- Fixed bug in BattleFlowController where healAmount was used instead of actualHealing in log messages
- Enhanced error handling throughout the system

## Testing
Extensive testing conducted to verify:
- Identical behavior between toggle-on and toggle-off modes
- Proper event handling (CHARACTER_HEALED events)
- Correct resurrection behavior
- Passive ability triggers (onHealed, onHealingDone, onRevive)
- Edge cases (healing full HP characters, healing dead characters)

## Next Steps
Version 0.5.25 will focus on the component integration phase:
- Testing complete system with all Stage 4 components working together
- Handling edge cases in the interaction between damage and healing components
- Adding comprehensive error handling for all component interactions

*Note: This refactoring is part of Stage 4 of the larger BattleManager refactoring plan, which extracts the monolithic battle logic into specialized, maintainable components.*
