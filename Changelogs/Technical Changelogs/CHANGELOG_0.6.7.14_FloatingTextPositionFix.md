# Changelog: Floating Text Position Fix

## Version 0.6.7.14 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update fixes the positioning issue with floating damage/healing numbers in the battle scene. Previously, damage/healing numbers would appear at incorrect positions on the screen (often far to the left), making it difficult to associate them with their corresponding characters. The issue was caused by using local container coordinates instead of global screen coordinates when positioning the floating text.

### Files Changed
1. `js/phaser/components/battle/CharacterSprite.js`

### Technical Problem Analysis
The root cause of the positioning issue was in the `showFloatingText()` method in `CharacterSprite.js`. The method was using the container's local coordinates (`this.container.x` and `this.container.y`) to position the text:

```javascript
// Create text
const floatingText = this.scene.add.text(
    this.container.x,
    this.container.y - 50, // Initial position slightly higher
    text,
    mergedStyle
).setOrigin(0.5);
```

This approach only works correctly when the container is a direct child of the scene, with no additional transformations or parent containers. In more complex scenarios, such as when the character container is nested within a team container or has rotations, scaling, or other transformations applied, the local coordinates don't correspond to the screen position where the text should appear.

### Solution Implementation
The solution was to use Phaser's `getWorldTransformMatrix()` method to convert local container coordinates to global screen coordinates:

```javascript
// Get global position of the character using world transform matrix
let globalPosition = new Phaser.Math.Vector2();
this.container.getWorldTransformMatrix().transformPoint(0, 0, globalPosition);

// Create text at the correct global position
const floatingText = this.scene.add.text(
    globalPosition.x,
    globalPosition.y - 50, // Initial position slightly higher
    text,
    mergedStyle
).setOrigin(0.5);
```

This approach ensures that the text appears at the correct position on the screen, regardless of the container's nesting or transformations. 

### Additional Improvements

1. **Validation Checks**: Added a check to ensure the container has the `getWorldTransformMatrix` method before attempting to use it.

2. **Depth Setting**: Added explicit depth setting (`setDepth(1000)`) to ensure the floating text appears above other elements in the scene.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Used optional chaining (`this.character?.name`) to prevent errors when the character object is undefined or null.

4. **Logging**: Added logging to clearly indicate when and where the global position calculation is being used, which will help with debugging.

### Technical Details

#### Transform Matrix Conversion
The key to fixing this issue is understanding how Phaser handles coordinate systems. When dealing with nested containers or objects with transformations, we need to convert from the object's local coordinate system to the global screen coordinate system.

The `getWorldTransformMatrix()` method returns a matrix that represents all transformations (translations, rotations, scaling) applied to the object and its parent hierarchy. The `transformPoint()` method then applies this matrix to convert a point from local to global coordinates.

In our case, we're converting the point (0, 0) - which represents the center of the character container - to its equivalent position in the global coordinate system.

#### Depth System
Phaser uses a depth system to control which objects appear on top of others. By setting a high depth value (1000) for the floating text, we ensure it appears above other game elements, even if they have custom depth values set.

### Testing and Verification
The implementation was verified by testing the following scenarios:

1. **Characters in Different Positions**: Damage/healing numbers now appear correctly above characters regardless of their position on the screen.

2. **Nested Containers**: The fix works correctly when characters are part of nested container hierarchies.

3. **Transformed Containers**: The fix handles cases where containers have rotations, scaling, or other transformations applied.

4. **Edge Cases**: The enhanced error handling prevents crashes when dealing with invalid character data or missing methods.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Local vs. Global Coordinates**: When positioning UI elements in a complex scene, always consider whether local or global coordinates are needed. For UI elements that should appear at a specific screen position, global coordinates are typically the right choice.

2. **Defensive Programming**: The addition of validation checks and enhanced error handling makes the code more robust, preventing cascading failures from invalid data or missing methods.

3. **Transform Matrices**: Understanding how transform matrices work in a scene graph is crucial for correctly positioning elements in complex UI hierarchies.

### Future Considerations

1. **CombatFeedbackManager**: This fix is a crucial step toward implementing a comprehensive `CombatFeedbackManager` component that will centralize all combat feedback (damage, healing, crits, misses).

2. **Consistent Depth Management**: As new visual elements are added to the battle scene, a more systematic approach to depth management may be needed to ensure everything appears in the correct order.

3. **Visual Feedback Standardization**: With the positioning issue fixed, we can now focus on enhancing the visual design of damage/healing numbers, including different sizes, colors, and animations for different types of feedback.
