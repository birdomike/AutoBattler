# CHANGELOG 0.5.21c: Effects Array Health Event Fix

## Issue Description
A critical issue was identified where character health bars were not updating correctly when abilities used the new `effects` array system, even though their internal health values were being properly changed. While diagnostic logging (added in v0.5.21b) revealed that `CHARACTER_DAMAGED` and `CHARACTER_HEALED` events were being properly dispatched for basic attacks and legacy abilities, these events were missing for abilities that used the newer effects array approach.

## Root Cause
The `BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect` method was correctly processing health changes via `processEffect()` for abilities that used the effects array pattern, but it was immediately returning after the loop without dispatching the necessary UI update events. In contrast, the legacy code path (for older abilities) was properly dispatching these events, explaining why some health bars updated while others didn't.

## Fix Implementation
The solution involves enhancing the effects array handling to also dispatch the appropriate events:

1. Track health changes by capturing the character's health before and after processing the effects array
2. Dispatch the appropriate event based on whether the character was damaged or healed
3. Remove the temporary diagnostic logging that was added in v0.5.21b

### Code Changes

The fix modified `BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect` to include event dispatching for the effects array path:

```javascript
// Check if this is an action with the new effects array
if (action.ability && action.ability.effects && Array.isArray(action.ability.effects) && action.ability.effects.length > 0) {
    // Store the target's original health before processing effects
    const originalHealth = action.target.currentHp;
    
    // New effect system - process each effect in the array
    for (const effect of action.ability.effects) {
        this.battleManager.processEffect(effect, action.actor, action.target, action.ability);
    }
    
    // After processing all effects, check if health has changed
    const newHealth = action.target.currentHp;
    const healthChange = originalHealth - newHealth;
    
    // If health decreased (damage was dealt)
    if (healthChange > 0) {
        console.log(`Effects array reduced ${action.target.name}'s health by ${healthChange}`);
        
        // Dispatch CHARACTER_DAMAGED event
        if (window.battleBridge && healthChange > 0) {
            try {
                window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, {
                    character: action.target,
                    target: action.target,
                    newHealth: action.target.currentHp,
                    maxHealth: action.target.stats.hp,
                    amount: healthChange,
                    source: action.actor,
                    ability: action.ability
                });
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching CHARACTER_DAMAGED event:', error);
            }
        }
    } 
    // If health increased (healing was applied)
    else if (healthChange < 0) {
        const healAmount = Math.abs(healthChange);
        console.log(`Effects array increased ${action.target.name}'s health by ${healAmount}`);
        
        // Dispatch CHARACTER_HEALED event
        if (window.battleBridge && healAmount > 0) {
            try {
                window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_HEALED, {
                    character: action.target,
                    target: action.target,
                    newHealth: action.target.currentHp,
                    maxHealth: action.target.stats.hp,
                    amount: healAmount,
                    source: action.actor,
                    ability: action.ability
                });
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching CHARACTER_HEALED event:', error);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return;
}
```

## Technical Notes

1. **Multi-target Support**: The fix works with the existing multi-target ability implementation, which already handles array targets by creating individual single-target actions and calling `applyActionEffect` recursively for each target.

2. **Event Dispatch Consistency**: The implementation ensures that the exact same event data payload is used for both the effects array path and the legacy path, maintaining consistent behavior across the application.

3. **Diagnostic Cleanup**: All temporary diagnostic logging from v0.5.21b has been removed now that the issue has been identified and fixed.

## Testing Verification

Testing confirms that health bars now update correctly for all abilities, regardless of whether they use the legacy approach or the newer effects array system. Visual feedback is consistent for:

1. Basic attacks
2. Legacy damage/healing abilities
3. Newer abilities using the effects array pattern
4. Multiple targets when applicable

This fix maintains backward compatibility while ensuring that the newer, more modular ability system works correctly with the UI.
