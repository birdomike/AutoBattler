# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.2 - BattleAssetLoader Stage 2 Implementation (Parts 1-2)

## Overview

This update implements Stage 2 (Parts 1-2) of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan, which extracts character asset loading logic from BattleScene.js into the dedicated BattleAssetLoader component. This is part of an ongoing effort to reduce the complexity of BattleScene.js and improve the separation of concerns within the codebase.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added `loadCharacterAssets()` Method to BattleAssetLoader

Created a new method in BattleAssetLoader.js that encapsulates all character asset loading logic:

```javascript
loadCharacterAssets() {
    console.log("[BattleAssetLoader] Loading character assets...");
    
    if (!this.scene || !this.scene.load) {
        console.error("[BattleAssetLoader] Cannot load character assets - scene or loader not available");
        return;
    }
    
    try {
        // Basic placeholder asset
        this.scene.load.image('character-circle', 'assets/images/icons/character-circle.png');
        
        // Preload all combat-optimized character art
        const characterArt = [
            'Aqualia', 'Drakarion', 'Zephyr', 'Lumina', 
            'Sylvanna', 'Vaelgor', 'Seraphina' 
        ];
        
        // Special case for Caste due to parentheses in filename
        const casteKey = 'character_Caste';
        const castePath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Caste.png';
        this.scene.load.image(casteKey, castePath);
        console.log(`[BattleAssetLoader] Preloading combat-optimized character image ${casteKey} from ${castePath}`);
        
        characterArt.forEach(name => {
            const key = `character_${name}`;
            // Use the combat-optimized versions of character art
            const path = `assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/${name}.png`;
            this.scene.load.image(key, path);
            console.log(`[BattleAssetLoader] Preloading combat-optimized character image ${key} from ${path}`);
        });
        
        console.log('[BattleAssetLoader] Character art preload complete');
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('[BattleAssetLoader] Could not preload character art:', error);
    }
}
```

The method includes:
- Proper validation of scene and loader availability
- Full error handling with try/catch
- Consistent logging with the BattleAssetLoader prefix
- Loading of all character assets that were previously in BattleScene.js

### 2. Updated BattleScene.js to Use BattleAssetLoader for Character Assets

Modified BattleScene.js to use the new method while maintaining the fallback path:

```javascript
// In BattleScene.js preload()
if (window.BattleAssetLoader) {
    this.assetLoader = new window.BattleAssetLoader(this);
    this.assetLoader.loadUIAssets();
    this.assetLoader.loadCharacterAssets(); // Add character asset loading through the loader
    
    // Preload status effect icons - call our dedicated method instead
    this.preloadStatusEffectIcons();
} else {
    // Original fallback code remains unchanged for now
    // Will be simplified in Parts 3-4
}
```

These changes:
- Remove character asset loading code from the main BattleScene.js path
- Delegate to the BattleAssetLoader component when available
- Maintain the existing fallback code for now (to be removed in Part 4)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Character asset loading logic is now handled by a dedicated component rather than mixed into BattleScene's preload method.

2. **Better Maintainability**: Changing the character asset loading process (e.g., adding new characters or tweaking paths) can now be done in a single, focused component.

3. **Code Organization**: The BattleAssetLoader provides a central place for all battle-related asset loading, making the code easier to understand and navigate.

4. **Defensive Programming**: The implementation includes comprehensive parameter validation and error handling at all levels.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:
1. All character assets load correctly when using BattleAssetLoader
2. Character sprites display properly during battles
3. Console logs show the proper loading messages from BattleAssetLoader
4. No error messages appear related to missing character assets

## Next Steps

Once testing confirms the new implementation works correctly, we'll proceed with:
1. Part 3: Test and verify character asset loading
2. Part 4: Remove the redundant character asset loading code from the fallback path

This incremental approach ensures we maintain functionality while progressively improving code organization.
