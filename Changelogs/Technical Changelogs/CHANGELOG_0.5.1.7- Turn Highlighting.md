# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.7 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Resolution: Turn Indicator Not Following Characters and DOM UI Appearing

This update fixes two critical issues:
1. The turn indicator was only appearing under the first character (Aqualia) and not moving to follow turn changes.
2. The old DOM-based battle UI was appearing instead of the Phaser UI due to a syntax error in BattleBridge.js.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 1: Turn Indicator Not Following Characters
The root cause was in `BattleScene.js`:
- The active character highlighting was not properly clearing previous highlights
- The `handleTurnStarted` method wasn't checking for both possible property names in the event data
- The event handling was incomplete and didn't properly move the indicator between characters

#### Issue 2: DOM UI Appearing Instead of Phaser UI
The root cause was a structural issue in `BattleBridge.js`:
- There was a piece of code at the top of the file that was detached from any function
- This code fragment was causing a syntax error, preventing the entire BattleBridge from initializing
- This in turn caused the system to fall back to the DOM-based UI

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleBridge.js
**Change 1**: Fixed the file structure by removing a detached code fragment from the top

```javascript
// REMOVED this code fragment from the top of the file:
// Also patch executeNextAction to dispatch TURN_STARTED for each character's action
if (this.battleManager.executeNextAction) {
    const originalExecuteNextAction = this.battleManager.executeNextAction;
    this.battleManager.executeNextAction = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: executeNextAction patched method called');
        
        // If there are actions in the queue, dispatch TURN_STARTED for the next action
        if (this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0) {
            const nextAction = this.actionQueue[0];
            console.log('BattleBridge: Next action is for character:', nextAction?.actor?.name);
            console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event for individual character action.');
            
            // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event for this character's action
            self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
                character: nextAction.actor,
                currentCharacter: nextAction.actor,
                turnNumber: this.currentTurn
            });
        }
        
        // Call original method
        return originalExecuteNextAction.apply(this, arguments);
    };
    console.log('BattleBridge: Successfully patched executeNextAction method');
} else {
    console.warn('BattleBridge: Could not patch executeNextAction, method not found');
}
```

**Change 2**: Added the `executeNextAction` patch properly at the end of the `patchBattleManager` method

```javascript
// Added at the end of the patchBattleManager method:
// Also patch executeNextAction to dispatch TURN_STARTED for each character's action
if (this.battleManager.executeNextAction) {
    const originalExecuteNextAction = this.battleManager.executeNextAction;
    this.battleManager.executeNextAction = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: executeNextAction patched method called');
        
        // If there are actions in the queue, dispatch TURN_STARTED for the next action
        if (this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0) {
            const nextAction = this.actionQueue[0];
            console.log('BattleBridge: Next action is for character:', nextAction?.actor?.name);
            console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event for individual character action.');
            
            // Dispatch TURN_STARTED event for this character's action
            self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
                character: nextAction.actor,
                currentCharacter: nextAction.actor,
                turnNumber: this.currentTurn
            });
        }
        
        // Call original method
        return originalExecuteNextAction.apply(this, arguments);
    };
    console.log('BattleBridge: Successfully patched executeNextAction method');
} else {
    console.warn('BattleBridge: Could not patch executeNextAction, method not found');
}
```

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Change**: Enhanced the `handleTurnStarted` method to properly handle character changes

```javascript
handleTurnStarted(eventData) {
    console.log('[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data:', eventData);
    console.log('Event: TURN_STARTED', eventData);
    
    // Get the new active character
    const newActiveCharacter = eventData.character || eventData.currentCharacter; // ADDED: Check both property names
    if (!newActiveCharacter) {
        console.warn('Missing character data in TURN_STARTED event');
        return;
    }
    
    // Store the active character reference
    this.activeCharacter = newActiveCharacter; // MOVED: Store reference earlier
    
    // Determine the correct TeamContainer based on the character's team
    const teamContainer = newActiveCharacter.team === 'player' 
        ? this.playerTeamContainer 
        : this.enemyTeamContainer;
        
    if (!teamContainer) {
        console.warn(`Could not find team container for team: ${newActiveCharacter.team}`);
        return;
    }
    
    // Find the corresponding character sprite
    const activeSprite = teamContainer.getCharacterSpriteByName(newActiveCharacter.name);
    
    if (activeSprite) {
        // Clear any previous highlights - ADDED: These two lines
        if (this.playerTeamContainer) this.playerTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
        if (this.enemyTeamContainer) this.enemyTeamContainer.clearHighlights();
        
        // Highlight the active character - ADDED: This line
        teamContainer.highlightCharacter(newActiveCharacter.name);
        
        // Determine marker color based on team (blue for player, red for enemy)
        const markerColor = newActiveCharacter.team === 'player' ? 0x4488ff : 0xff4444;
        
        // Calculate position (under the character)
        const targetX = activeSprite.container.x;
        const targetY = activeSprite.container.y + 40; // Adjust this offset for best visual placement
        
        // Get battle speed multiplier
        const speedMultiplier = this.battleManager?.speedMultiplier || 1;
        
        // Define base animation duration and adjust for battle speed
        const baseFadeDuration = 250;
        const fadeDuration = baseFadeDuration / speedMultiplier;
        
        // Show the indicator at the calculated position
        if (this.turnIndicator) {
            this.turnIndicator.showAt(targetX, targetY, markerColor, fadeDuration);
        }
        
        console.log(`Turn indicator set for ${newActiveCharacter.name} at position: ${targetX},${targetY}`); // ADDED: Detailed logging
    } else {
        console.warn('Could not find active character sprite for:', newActiveCharacter?.name);
        
        // Hide the indicator if we can't find the character
        if (this.turnIndicator) {
            const baseFadeDuration = 250;
            const speedMultiplier = this.battleManager?.speedMultiplier || 1;
            const fadeDuration = baseFadeDuration / speedMultiplier;
            this.turnIndicator.hide(fadeDuration);
        }
    }
}
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

With these changes, both issues should be resolved:

1. **For the DOM UI Issue**: 
   - The Phaser UI should now appear correctly instead of the DOM UI
   - The BattleBridge class should initialize correctly with no syntax errors
   - The bridge should properly patch the BattleManager methods

2. **For the Turn Indicator Issue**:
   - The turn indicator should now properly follow each character as their turn comes up
   - When a new character's turn starts, any previous highlights will be cleared
   - The new active character will be highlighted and the turn indicator will appear below them
   - This will continue as turns progress through the battle

### Testing Steps

1. Start a battle in the Phaser UI (should now appear correctly instead of the DOM UI)
2. Observe as turns progress:
   - The turn indicator should move to highlight different characters
   - The active character should have a highlight effect
   - Previous highlights should be cleared when a new character becomes active
3. Confirm that the turn indicator properly follows both player and enemy characters
4. Check logs to ensure the proper events are being dispatched and received

### Implementation Lessons

This issue highlights several important principles:
1. **Syntax validation**: Even a small syntax error can cause an entire system to fail
2. **Property fallbacks**: Use OR logic (`||`) to check multiple property names in event data
3. **State clarity**: Ensure only one character is highlighted at a time by clearing previous states
4. **Visual coordination**: Multiple visual indicators (highlights, turn markers) should work together consistently
5. **Robust event handling**: Events should include multiple property names for compatibility with different components
