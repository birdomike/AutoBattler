# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.4b - BattleScene Syntax Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a critical syntax error in BattleScene.js that was preventing the battle scene from being displayed properly. The issue was caused by duplicate method definitions and a missing class closure.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed BattleScene.js Syntax Errors (Claude)
- Corrected syntax errors including duplicate method definitions for `update()` and `shutdown()`
- Added proper class closure with missing closing brace
- Implemented missing method stubs including `createReturnButton()`
- Added empty method implementations for all referenced but unimplemented methods
- Updated version number in code comments and visual elements

### 2. Enhanced Empty Team Handling (Michael)
- Added robust handling for empty enemy teams with placeholder enemies
- Improved error handling throughout the battle scene initialization
- Added fallback to generate an enemy team when none is provided

### 3. Added Return Button Implementation (Claude)
- Implemented the `createReturnButton()` method to allow returning to TeamBuilder
- Added proper cleanup and UI transition when returning from battle
- Enhanced visual feedback with button hover effects

### 4. Added Debug Tools (Claude)
- Implemented debug panel creation and toggle functionality
- Added basic battle event handlers for turn indicators, damage/healing text, and battle results
- Added visual feedback for battle events

## Technical Details
- The core issue was in BattleScene.js where:
  1. The `update()` and `shutdown()` methods were duplicated
  2. The class was missing its closing brace
  3. Several method stubs were declared but not implemented
- Additionally, the enemy team was sometimes empty, causing issues with team containers
- The changes maintain compatibility with the existing TeamBuilderUI and BattleManager integration

## Testing Notes
- Verify that the Battle Scene renders properly when starting a battle
- Confirm that placeholder enemies appear when no enemy team is provided
- Check that the return button works to go back to the TeamBuilder UI
- Ensure character art appears properly for both player and enemy teams
