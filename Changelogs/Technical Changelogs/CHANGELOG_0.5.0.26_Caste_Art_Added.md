# CHANGELOG_0.5.0.26_Caste_Art_Added.md

## Overview
This update renames the character "Riven" to "Caste" and ensures all art references are properly updated across the game systems. The primary challenge was maintaining proper art display in both the TeamBuilder UI and the Phaser-based Battle Scene, which use different loading mechanisms for character artwork.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Character Data Update
Modified `characters.json` to rename the character and update all ability IDs:

```diff
-      "id": 7,
-      "name": "Riven",
+      "id": 7,
+      "name": "Caste",
       "type": "metal",
       "role": "Berserker",
       "rarity": "Epic",
...
-          "id": "riven_shatter_blade",
+          "id": "caste_shatter_blade",
           "name": "Shatter Blade",
...
-          "id": "riven_battle_fury",
+          "id": "caste_battle_fury",
           "name": "Battle Fury",
...
-          "id": "riven_bloodthirst",
+          "id": "caste_bloodthirst",
           "name": "Bloodthirst",
...
-          "id": "riven_battle_mastery",
+          "id": "caste_battle_mastery",
           "name": "Battle Mastery",
```

### 2. TeamBuilder UI Image References
Updated `TeamBuilderImageLoader.js` to include the new character art path:

```diff
         this.characterImages = {
             'Aqualia': 'assets/images/Character Art/Aqualia.png',
             'Drakarion': 'assets/images/Character Art/Drakarion.png',
             'Zephyr': 'assets/images/Character Art/Zephyr.png',
             'Lumina': 'assets/images/Character Art/Lumina.png',
             'Sylvanna': 'assets/images/Character Art/Sylvanna.png',
-            'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png'
+            'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png',
+            'Caste': 'assets/images/Character Art/Caste.png'
         };
```

### 3. DOM Battle UI Image References
Updated `DirectImageLoader.js` to include the new character art path:

```diff
     characterImages: {
         'Aqualia': 'assets/images/Character Art/Aqualia.png',
         'Drakarion': 'assets/images/Character Art/Drakarion.png',
         'Zephyr': 'assets/images/Character Art/Zephyr.png',
         'Lumina': 'assets/images/Character Art/Lumina.png',
         'Sylvanna': 'assets/images/Character Art/Sylvanna.png',
-        'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png'
+        'Vaelgor': 'assets/images/Character Art/Vaelgor.png',
+        'Caste': 'assets/images/Character Art/Caste.png'
     },
```

### 4. Battle Scene Art Loading
The most critical fix was in `BattleScene.js` where the image loading was using an incorrect path:

```diff
-            // Special case for Riven due to parentheses in filename
-            const rivenKey = 'character_Riven';
-            const rivenPath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Riven(Caste).png';
-            this.load.image(rivenKey, rivenPath);
-            console.log(`BattleScene: Preloading combat-optimized character image ${rivenKey} from ${rivenPath}`);
+            // Special case for Caste due to parentheses in filename
+            const casteKey = 'character_Caste';
+            const castePath = 'assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/Caste.png';
+            this.load.image(casteKey, castePath);
+            console.log(`BattleScene: Preloading combat-optimized character image ${casteKey} from ${castePath}`);
```

This was the key issue - the preload function in BattleScene.js was still looking for a file named "Riven(Caste).png" when it should have been looking for "Caste.png". CharacterSprite.js uses the texture key "character_Caste" when creating sprites, but this key wasn't being properly loaded.

## Problem Analysis
The issue revealed a subtle implementation detail of the game's character art system:

1. TeamBuilder UI uses the TeamBuilderImageLoader which loads art directly by character name
2. DOM Battle UI uses the DirectImageLoader which also loads art by character name
3. Phaser Battle Scene uses a preload mechanism with specific texture keys in the format "character_[Name]"

When renaming a character, all three systems must be updated correctly. The TeamBuilder and DOM Battle UIs were properly updated with the new art paths, but BattleScene.js had a special case for "Riven" that wasn't correctly updated.

## Verification
After making these changes:
- The character appears with correct artwork in TeamBuilder UI
- The character appears with correct artwork in Battle Scene UI
- All abilities function properly with updated IDs
- The character's stats and role remain unchanged

## Lessons Learned
When renaming characters or updating art paths:
1. Check all image loading systems (TeamBuilderImageLoader, DirectImageLoader, BattleScene preload)
2. Pay particular attention to special cases in the preload method of BattleScene.js
3. Ensure consistency between character name in characters.json and texture keys in Phaser
