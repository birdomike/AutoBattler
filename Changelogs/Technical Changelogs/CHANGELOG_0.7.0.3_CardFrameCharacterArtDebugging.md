# CardFrame Character Art Debugging (0.7.0.3)

This update addresses two issues related to the CardFrame integration:

1. Updated the fallback message in CharacterSprite.js to more accurately reflect the game's implementation, changing from "falling back to circle representation" to "falling back to just using character art" since the game doesn't use circles.

2. Added enhanced debug logging to the CardFrame.createCharacterSprite() method to help diagnose why character art isn't appearing in card frames. The new logging includes:
   - Confirmation of the character key being used
   - Verification of texture existence with explicit result logging
   - Listing of available character textures for comparison
   - Texture dimensions when available
   - Position and scale information
   - Mask application status
   - Confirmation of adding the sprite to the portrait container

These changes will help identify the root cause of the missing character art in card frames while providing a more accurate user experience through improved error messages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Fallback Message

Changed the warning message in CharacterSprite.js from:
```javascript
console.warn(`CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested for ${character.name} but not available, falling back to circle representation`);
```

To:
```javascript
console.warn(`CharacterSprite: CardFrame requested for ${character.name} but not available, falling back to just using character art`);
```

### 2. Enhanced CardFrame Debugging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the `createCharacterSprite()` method in CardFrame.js:

- Added texture existence validation with detailed output
- Added available texture listing for debugging (filtered to character textures)
- Added texture dimension logging
- Added positioning and scaling logs
- Added mask application status logging
- Added confirmation of successful sprite creation and addition

## Next Steps

After testing these changes, we should have enough information to determine why character sprites aren't appearing in the card frames, which will inform our next implementation phase. The logs will help identify whether:

1. The textures aren't being found (naming/path issue)
2. The sprites are being created but incorrectly positioned 
3. The mask is incorrectly applied, potentially hiding the sprites
4. Other issues are occurring during the sprite creation process
