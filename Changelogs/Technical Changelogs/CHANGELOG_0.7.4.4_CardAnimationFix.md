# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.4 - Card Animation Fix

## Overview
This update fixes an issue with card attack animations that was introduced during the centralization of card visual properties. The cards would disappear entirely during attack animations instead of smoothly moving toward the target with a tilting motion. This patch ensures that attack animations properly reference card dimensions from the new Single Source of Truth (CardFrameVisualComponent).

## Problem Analysis

After implementing the CardFrame configuration refactoring in version 0.7.4.3, attack animations no longer worked correctly. Analysis revealed the following issues:

1. **Missing Dimension References**: In the `showAttackAnimation` method of `CharacterSprite.js`, the animation was trying to use `this.cardConfig.width` and `this.cardConfig.height`, which were removed during refactoring in favor of centralized dimensions in `CardFrameVisualComponent.js`.

2. **Incorrect Movement Calculation**: Without valid width/height values, the animation was calculating invalid movement coordinates, causing the card to move far off-screen during attack animations.

3. **Similar Issue in Floating Text**: The `showFloatingText` method was also using `this.cardConfig.height` to position text above the card, resulting in incorrectly positioned floating damage/healing numbers.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Updated Card Attack Animation

Modified the `showAttackAnimation` method in `CharacterSprite.js` to properly access card dimensions from the visualComponent:

```javascript
// Get current card dimensions from visualComponent or use defaults
let currentCardWidth = 240; // Fallback default
let currentCardHeight = 320; // Fallback default

if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    // Get dimensions from the visual component (single source of truth)
    currentCardWidth = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.width;
    currentCardHeight = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.height;
    console.log(`[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] ${this.character.name}: Using card dimensions from visualComponent: ${currentCardWidth}x${currentCardHeight}`);
} else {
    console.warn(`[CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation] ${this.character.name}: Could not get card dimensions from visualComponent for animation. Using fallback.`);
}

// Calculate move destination in local space
const moveToX = direction.x * currentCardWidth * moveDistance;
const moveToY = direction.y * currentCardHeight * moveDistance;
```

This change ensures that:
- The animation uses the correct dimensions from the visualComponent
- There's a fallback to standard dimensions if the component chain is broken
- Proper logging helps diagnose any issues

### 2. Fixed Floating Text Positioning

Updated the `showFloatingText` method to also get card height from the visualComponent:

```javascript
// For card frames, get height from visualComponent if available
let cardHeight = 320; // Fallback default

if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    cardHeight = this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config.height;
} else {
    console.warn(`showFloatingText (${this.character?.name}): Could not get card height from visualComponent. Using fallback.`);
}

// Position text above the card
yOffset = -cardHeight/2 - 20;
```

This ensures consistent positioning of floating damage/healing numbers above cards, regardless of the card variant used.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Reference Chain
The implementation uses a clear reference chain to access the card dimensions:
1. `this.cardFrame` → The CardFrame instance
2. `this.cardFrame.manager` → The CardFrameManager instance
3. `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent` → The CardFrameVisualComponent instance
4. `this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config` → The component's configuration with dimensions

### Defensive Programming
Multiple layers of null checks protect against errors if any part of the reference chain is missing:

```javascript
if (this.cardFrame && this.cardFrame.manager && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent && 
    this.cardFrame.manager.visualComponent.config) {
    // Safe to access values
}
```

### Fallback Mechanism
Default values ensure the animation works even if the visualComponent is unavailable:

```javascript
let currentCardWidth = 240; // Fallback default
let currentCardHeight = 320; // Fallback default
```

### Logging
Informative log messages help diagnose issues:
- Success: `Using card dimensions from visualComponent: ${currentCardWidth}x${currentCardHeight}`
- Failure: `Could not get card dimensions from visualComponent for animation. Using fallback.`

## Testing Verification

The changes were manually tested to ensure:
1. Cards properly animate toward targets during attacks
2. The tilting rotation motion works correctly
3. Cards return to their original position after attacks
4. Impact effects appear at the correct time
5. Floating text appears in the correct position above cards
6. Animations work with different card variants (standard, large, compact)
7. No console errors appear during animations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reference Tracing**: When centralizing properties, ensure all references are updated, especially in animation code.

2. **Defensive Programming**: Always include fallbacks and null checks when accessing properties through a reference chain.

3. **Reference Chain Documentation**: Document complex reference chains to aid debugging and maintenance.

4. **Complete Refactoring**: When moving properties to a new location, search for all usages across the codebase, including animation code.

5. **Test Visual Feedback**: Always test visual feedback and animations after refactoring, as they're critical for user experience.

## Next Steps

With all visual properties now properly centralized and animations working correctly, future enhancements could include:

1. **Animation Variants**: Allow card variants to define their own animation parameters (distance, rotation, duration)

2. **Variant-Specific Effects**: Create specialized impact effects or animations for different card variants

3. **Comprehensive Reference Tracking**: Implement a more robust system to track and update property references during refactoring
