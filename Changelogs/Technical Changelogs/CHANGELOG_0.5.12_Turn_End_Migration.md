# CHANGELOG 0.5.12 - Turn End & Battle Conclusion Migration

## Summary

Version 0.5.12 completes the next major phase of the BattleManager refactoring by migrating three critical methods to the BattleFlowController: `finishTurn()`, `checkBattleEnd()`, and `endBattle()`. This change builds on previous controller migrations (startBattle, startNextTurn, executeNextAction) to further modularize the battle flow logic and improve maintainability.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows our established "strangler pattern" refactoring strategy:

1. **Controller Implementation**: Create full implementations of the three methods in BattleFlowController
2. **Wrapper Addition**: Add delegation wrappers to the original methods in BattleManager
3. **Bridge Patching Removal**: Remove redundant patches in BattleBridge now handled by direct event dispatching
4. **Event Flow Optimization**: Implement direct event dispatching from BattleFlowController

## Detailed Changes

### 1. BattleFlowController Implementation

Three methods were implemented in BattleFlowController:

#### `async finishTurn()`

```javascript
async finishTurn() {
    // Set turn flag to false
    this.battleManager.turnInProgress = false;
    
    // Delegate cooldown reduction
    this.battleManager.reduceCooldowns();
    
    // Delegate end-of-turn passive processing
    this.battleManager.processPassiveAbilities('onTurnEnd', { controller: this });
    
    // Delegate turn summary logging
    this.battleManager.displayTurnSummary();
    
    // Check if battle has ended
    const battleOver = await this.checkBattleEnd();
    
    // If battle continues, schedule next turn
    if (!battleOver) {
        const baseDelay = this.battleManager.turnDelay;
        const speedMultiplier = this.battleManager.speedMultiplier;
        const actualDelay = baseDelay / speedMultiplier;
        
        setTimeout(() => this.startNextTurn(), actualDelay);
    }
    
    // Dispatch TURN_ENDED event
    if (window.battleBridge) {
        try {
            console.log('[BattleFlowController] Dispatching TURN_ENDED event');
            window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_ENDED, {
                turnNumber: this.battleManager.currentTurn
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching TURN_ENDED event:', error);
        }
    }
}
```

#### `async checkBattleEnd()`

```javascript
async checkBattleEnd() {
    // Count defeated members in each team
    const playerDefeated = this.battleManager.playerTeam.filter(char => char.isDefeated()).length;
    const enemyDefeated = this.battleManager.enemyTeam.filter(char => char.isDefeated()).length;
    
    // Determine if all players or all enemies are defeated
    const allPlayersDefeated = playerDefeated >= this.battleManager.playerTeam.length;
    const allEnemiesDefeated = enemyDefeated >= this.battleManager.enemyTeam.length;
    
    // If battle has ended, call endBattle with appropriate result
    if (allPlayersDefeated || allEnemiesDefeated) {
        let result = 'draw';
        
        if (allPlayersDefeated && !allEnemiesDefeated) {
            result = 'defeat';
        } else if (!allPlayersDefeated && allEnemiesDefeated) {
            result = 'victory';
        }
        
        await this.endBattle(result);
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

#### `async endBattle(result)`

```javascript
async endBattle(result) {
    // Set battle state to inactive
    this.battleManager.battleActive = false;
    
    // Clear the turn timer
    clearTimeout(this.battleManager.turnTimer);
    
    // Delegate end-of-battle passive processing
    this.battleManager.processPassiveAbilities('onBattleEnd', { result });
    
    // Log battle result
    const resultMessages = {
        'victory': 'Victory! All enemies have been defeated.',
        'defeat': 'Defeat! Your team has been defeated.',
        'draw': 'Draw! Both teams have been defeated.'
    };
    
    this.battleManager.logMessage(resultMessages[result], 'battle-result');
    
    // Dispatch BATTLE_ENDED Event
    if (window.battleBridge) {
        try {
            console.log(`[BattleFlowController] Dispatching BATTLE_ENDED event. Winner: ${result}`);
            window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(window.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_ENDED, { winner: result });
        } catch (error) { 
            console.error('[BattleFlowController] Error dispatching BATTLE_ENDED event:', error); 
        }
    }
    
    // Delegate DOM UI update
    if (this.battleManager.battleUI) {
        this.battleManager.battleUI.showBattleResult(result);
    }
}
```

### 2. BattleManager Wrapper Implementation

Added delegation wrappers to all three methods in BattleManager:

```javascript
finishTurn(...args) {
    // --- Start Wrapper ---
    if (this.useNewFlowController && this.battleFlowController) {
        console.log(`[BattleManager] Attempting to delegate finishTurn to BattleFlowController`);
        try {
            if (typeof this.battleFlowController.finishTurn === 'function') {
                 // Delegate the call, passing all original arguments
                 // Use await if the controller method is async AND if the return value is needed here
                 // For checkBattleEnd, we need the return value. For others, likely not.
                 if ('finishTurn' === 'checkBattleEnd') {
                      return this.battleFlowController.finishTurn(...args); // MUST return value
                 } else {
                      this.battleFlowController.finishTurn(...args);
                      return; // Exit after delegation if no return value needed
                 }
            } else {
                 console.warn(`[BattleManager] finishTurn not found on BattleFlowController. Falling back to legacy.`);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`[BattleManager] Error delegating finishTurn:`, error, 'Falling back to legacy.');
        }
    }

    // --- Legacy / Fallback Implementation ---
    console.log(`[BattleManager] Using legacy finishTurn implementation`);
    // START ORIGINAL CODE
    // ... original method implementation ...
    // END ORIGINAL CODE
}
```

Similar wrappers were added to `checkBattleEnd` and `endBattle` methods, with special handling for `checkBattleEnd` to ensure it returns the controller's result value.

### 3. BattleBridge Patch Removal

Removed the following sections from BattleBridge.js:

```javascript
// Patch endBattle
if (originalEndBattle) {
    this.battleManager.endBattle = function() {
        const result = originalEndBattle.apply(this, arguments);
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.BATTLE_ENDED, {
            winner: this.winner,
            playerTeam: this.playerTeam,
            enemyTeam: this.enemyTeam
        });
        return result;
    };
}
```

And replaced with:

```javascript
// Removed endBattle patch - Handled by BattleFlowController
```

The BattleBridge no longer needs to patch these methods because:
1. Direct event dispatching is now done in the BattleFlowController
2. Delegation through the wrapper ensures all events are properly dispatched
3. This improves code organization by centralizing battle flow events in the controller

## Testing Results

The refactored battle flow has been tested with various scenarios:

1. **Normal Battle Flow**: Confirmed that turns end properly and next turns get scheduled
2. **Battle End Detection**: Verified victory, defeat, and draw conditions are properly detected
3. **Battle End Screen**: Confirmed proper battle result display and messaging
4. **Event Dispatching**: Validated that all UI elements continue to respond properly to state changes

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with existing UI components through proper event dispatching.

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Battle flow logic is now more centralized in the BattleFlowController
2. **Better Testability**: Methods are more focused and have clearer inputs/outputs
3. **Reduced Coupling**: BattleManager has fewer direct dependencies on UI and event management
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Future changes to battle flow can be made in a single component
5. **Cleaner Event Flow**: Direct event dispatching from the controller creates a more predictable event model

## Next Steps (for Version 0.5.13)

- Remove the useNewFlowController toggle and legacy code paths
- Delete all BattleBridge patches related to the refactored methods
- Complete comprehensive testing of all battle scenarios
- Clean up any remaining diagnostic logs
