# Changelog: Team Slot Art Visibility Fix

## Version 0.6.7.11 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update resolves the persistent issue where character art was not appearing in the 'Your Team' slots despite being properly added to the DOM. While version 0.6.7.10 added comprehensive diagnostic logging that confirmed the art elements were being created correctly, this update addresses the specific CSS styling issues that were preventing the art from being visible.

### Root Cause Analysis
The diagnostic logs from version 0.6.7.10 provided clear evidence that:
1. The `drawArt()` function in TeamBuilderImageLoader was being called correctly
2. The image elements were being successfully created in the DOM
3. The art wrapper and image tags were present in the final DOM structure

This confirmed that the JavaScript logic was working correctly, and the issue was specifically related to CSS styling and visibility in the 'Your Team' slots.

After thorough investigation, we identified the following CSS-related issues:

1. **Context-Specific Styling Gap**: While there were specific styles for `.hero-card` and `.hero-avatar-container` in the hero grid, there were no equivalent styles specifically for the team slot context (`.slot-content .hero-avatar-container`).

2. **Inadequate Dimensions**: The avatar containers in team slots did not have explicitly defined dimensions suitable for displaying character art.

3. **Z-Index and Positioning**: The character art in team slots needed proper z-index and positioning to be visible above other elements.

4. **Display and Opacity**: Some CSS rules affecting visibility were not being applied specifically to the team slot context.

### Technical Implementation

The solution involved adding targeted CSS rules specifically for the team slot context:

```css
/* Fix for character art in team slots */
.slot-content .hero-avatar-container {
    position: relative;
    width: 60px;
    height: 60px;
    margin-right: 12px;
    overflow: visible; /* Ensure art isn't clipped */
}

.slot-content .hero-avatar-container .hero-art-wrapper {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: block !important;
    z-index: 5;
}

.slot-content .hero-avatar-container .team-builder-art {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100px; /* Adjusted for team slot context */
    height: 100px; /* Adjusted for team slot context */
    top: -20px;
    left: -20px;
    display: block !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    z-index: 10;
}

/* Make sure the hero-details has proper layout */
.slot-content .hero-details {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 60px;
}
```

These CSS rules address each of the identified issues:

1. **Context-Specific Styling**: Added rules specifically for `.slot-content .hero-avatar-container` to target the team slots context.

2. **Explicit Dimensions**: Set width, height, and margin properties suitable for the team slot layout.

3. **Proper Positioning**: Set position to relative for the container and absolute for the art wrapper and image.

4. **Visibility Enforcement**: Added `display: block !important` and `opacity: 1 !important` to ensure visibility.

5. **Z-Index Hierarchy**: Set appropriate z-index values to ensure art appears above other elements.

6. **Overflow Handling**: Set `overflow: visible` to ensure art is not clipped by container boundaries.

### Testing and Verification

The solution was verified by:

1. **Visual Inspection**: Confirmed character art is now visible in team slots in both 'Full' and 'Compact' view modes.

2. **Class Verification**: Verified that the `.team-builder-art` class is indeed present on the image elements and that the new CSS rules are being applied.

3. **Style Specificity**: Checked that the new styles are not being overridden by other CSS rules with higher specificity.

4. **Multiple Characters**: Tested with various characters to ensure consistent appearance regardless of character type.

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verified the fix works across supported browsers.

### Key Takeaways

1. **DOM vs. Visibility Issues**: The diagnostic logging in 0.6.7.10 was crucial in confirming this was a pure CSS/visibility issue rather than a problem with the JavaScript logic creating the elements.

2. **Context-Specific Styling**: This highlights the importance of context-specific CSS rules when components are used in different UI contexts.

3. **CSS Specificity**: The solution prioritized targeted, specific CSS selectors to ensure the rules apply only where needed.

4. **Defensive CSS**: Used `!important` judiciously where needed to ensure critical visibility properties are not overridden.

This fix completes the work started in 0.6.7.9 and 0.6.7.10, finally resolving the character art visibility issue in team slots while maintaining the clean component-based architecture of the TeamBuilder UI.
