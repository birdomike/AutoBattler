# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.25 - AoE Ability Text Fix

## Issue Description

Area of Effect (AoE) abilities like "Tidal Wave" or "Frost Chain" were incorrectly displaying "Auto Attack" in the action indicator text above characters instead of the actual ability name. This was confusing for players who couldn't tell which ability was being used during multi-target animations.

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive debugging and analysis of logs, the root cause was identified:

1. When a character used an AoE ability, the initial CHARACTER_ACTION event was correctly dispatched with the proper ability name (e.g., "Tidal Wave").
2. The BattleEventManager correctly processed this event and called `CharacterSprite.showActionText()` with the proper ability name.
3. However, during the animation sequence, `CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation()` was explicitly calling `this.showActionText('Auto Attack')` for EVERY target of the AoE ability.
4. This hardcoded 'Auto Attack' text was overwriting the previously set, correct ability name.

The "smoking gun" was identified in `CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation()`:

```javascript
// Show auto attack action indicator
this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
```

This line was unconditionally setting the action text to "Auto Attack" regardless of whether the animation was for an auto-attack or an ability.

## Technical Solution

A simple but effective solution was implemented by removing the hardcoded text setting line:

```diff
- // Show auto attack action indicator
- this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
+ // REMOVED: No longer force 'Auto Attack' text for all animations
+ // this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
+ // This line was causing AoE abilities to display 'Auto Attack' instead of their actual name
```

This allows the text set by the initial CHARACTER_ACTION event (which correctly contains the ability name) to remain displayed during the animation sequence.

### Rationale for this Approach

1. **Simplicity**: The fix is minimal and targeted, affecting only the specific code causing the issue.
2. **Architectural Correctness**: The ability name should be determined by the event system, not hardcoded in the animation logic.
3. **Consistency**: This ensures the visual feedback matches the actual ability being used.

## Impact Analysis

This change affects:

1. **Visual Feedback**: Players will now see the correct ability name (e.g., "Tidal Wave") displayed above characters when AoE abilities are used.
2. **Auto-Attacks**: For actual auto-attacks, the action indicator will still display "Auto Attack" since that's what the initial CHARACTER_ACTION event will contain.
3. **Ability Animation**: The animation sequence remains unchanged; only the text displayed above the character is affected.

## Testing

The fix should be tested by:

1. Using characters with AoE abilities (e.g., Aqualia with "Tidal Wave")
2. Verifying that the ability name appears above the character during the animation
3. Confirming that regular auto-attacks still show "Auto Attack" text
4. Testing with multiple AoE abilities to ensure consistent behavior
5. Checking that different ability types (healing, damage, etc.) all display correctly

## Future Improvements

While this fix addresses the immediate issue, a more robust solution for the future could include:

1. Making the text setting conditional based on the actual action being performed:
```javascript
if (this.character && this.character.currentAction && this.character.currentAction.actionType === 'autoAttack') {
    this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
} else if (this.character && this.character.currentAction && this.character.currentAction.actionType === 'ability') {
    // Either do nothing (let event system handle it) or:
    // this.showActionText(this.character.currentAction.abilityName);
}
```

2. Modifying `showAttackAnimation()` to accept an optional action parameter that specifies the type of action being animated.

3. Enhancing the action indicator system to maintain a state of what's currently being displayed, to avoid unnecessary text updates.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be cautious with hardcoded values**: Hardcoded values like "Auto Attack" can cause issues when the code's context changes.

2. **Understand event flow**: The issue stemmed from multiple parts of the system trying to control the same UI element, with later calls overriding earlier ones.

3. **Component responsibility**: Animation components should focus on animation concerns and not override UI state set by the event system.

4. **Diagnostic value**: The debugging code added in previous versions was crucial for identifying this issue, demonstrating the value of comprehensive debug information.
