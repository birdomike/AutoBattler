# Technical Changelog: Version 0.6.3.7 - Fixed Ability Selection Issue

## Issue Summary
Characters in battle were only using auto-attacks and not selecting any abilities, despite having abilities available. Battle logs showed no ability usage messages, only damage being dealt.

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive investigation, the issue was traced to two interrelated problems:

1. **Case Sensitivity Mismatch**: The BattleManager was trying to access `this.battleManager.battleBehaviors` (lowercase) which was looking for `window.BattleBehaviors` (uppercase), but the fallback implementation was only registering as `window.battleBehaviors` (lowercase).

2. **Script Loading Order**: The fallback BattleBehaviors.js file was being loaded *after* BattleManager.js in index.html, which meant that BattleManager's initialization was running before the behavior system was available in the global window object.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Fallback BattleBehaviors.js
- Added proper uppercase global registration: `window.BattleBehaviors = window.battleBehaviors;`
- Enhanced debugging in the decideAction method to trace behavior selection
- Updated console logging message to indicate proper registration

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Register with uppercase 'B' for BattleManager compatibility
window.BattleBehaviors = window.battleBehaviors;

// Enhanced debugging to confirm it's being used
window.battleBehaviors.decideAction = function(decisionLogic, context) {
    console.log(`[DEBUG] BattleBehaviors.decideAction called with logic: ${decisionLogic}`);
    console.log(`[DEBUG] Available abilities:`, context.availableAbilities?.map(a => a.name) || []);
    
    // Rest of the existing implementation...
};

console.log('Fallback BattleBehaviors.js loaded successfully (registered as both window.battleBehaviors and window.BattleBehaviors)');
```

### 2. Fixed Script Loading Order in index.html
- Moved BattleBehaviors.js to load *before* BattleManager.js
- Added appropriate comment to explain the loading order requirement

```html
<!-- Battle Behaviors - Must be loaded before BattleManager -->
<script src="js/battle_logic/fallback/BattleBehaviors.js" defer></script>

<!-- Managers -->
<script src="js/managers/TeamManager.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/managers/BattleManager.js" defer></script>
```

## Testing and Validation
- Verified that BattleBehaviors is properly registered in the global window object
- Confirmed that debug logs show the decideAction method being called
- Tested in battles and observed characters now using abilities instead of just auto-attacks
- Battle log now shows proper ability usage messages

## Related Components
- BattleManager.js - Uses battleBehaviors for action and target selection
- ActionGenerator.js - Calls battleBehaviors.decideAction to select abilities
- BattleBehaviors.js - Provides action decision logic

## Follow-up Notes
Additional improvements could be made in the future:
1. Further enhance BattleManager's initializeBehaviorSystem to check both case variations
2. Add more specific error handling around behavior system initialization
3. Consider standardizing the casing convention across all component registrations
