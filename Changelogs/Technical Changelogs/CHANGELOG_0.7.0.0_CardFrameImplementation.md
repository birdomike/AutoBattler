# CardFrame Component Implementation - Technical Changelog

## Overview
This changelog documents the implementation of the new CardFrame component for the AutoBattler game. The CardFrame is a Phaser-based UI component that creates professional-looking card frames for characters with type-themed styling, portrait windows, decorative nameplates, and interactive features.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
- Created `CardFrame.js` as a Phaser.GameObjects.Container subclass
- Implemented a configuration-based approach with all visual parameters defined at the top
- Used a layered component architecture:
  - Base frame with 9-slice scaling for borders
  - Background elements with type-themed styling
  - Portrait window with masking for character art
  - Decorative nameplate with beveled edges and flourishes
  - Health bar system with visual feedback

### Key Features

#### 1. Type-Themed Styling
- Integrated with the existing type colors system (fire, water, nature, etc.)
- Applied type-specific colors to frame borders, nameplate, and glow effects
- Supported all 22 elemental types in the game

#### 2. Portrait Window with Masking
- Implemented proper image masking for character portraits
- Added subtle type-themed inner glow for the portrait frame
- Supported art positioning adjustments for different characters

#### 3. Decorative Nameplate
- Created a dedicated nameplate system with beveled edges and scrollwork
- Added support for decorative flourishes on either side of the name
- Implemented type-themed styling for nameplates with proper contrast

#### 4. Health Bar System
- Integrated a comprehensive health bar with animated transitions
- Added visual feedback for damage (shake, red flash) and healing (green glow, bounce)
- Used color coding based on health percentage (green > orange > red)

#### 5. Interactive Elements
- Implemented hover and selection states with smooth animations
- Added type-themed glow effects with adjustable intensity
- Supported callbacks for selection events

### Technical Implementation

#### Modular Design
- Each visual element is created by a dedicated method:
  - `createBaseFrame()`: Creates the main frame structure
  - `createBackgroundElements()`: Handles type-themed background
  - `createPortraitWindow()`: Creates masked portrait area
  - `createCharacterSprite()`: Handles character art
  - `createNameBanner()`: Creates decorative nameplate
  - `createHealthBar()`: Implements health visualization

#### Animation System
- Used Phaser tweens for smooth animations
- Implemented different animation states:
  - Normal state: Standard display
  - Hover state: Slight scale increase with partial glow
  - Selected state: Larger scale with full glow
  - Highlighted state: Pulsing animation for active turn

#### Defensive Programming
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the component
- Implemented fallback visuals when textures are missing
- Used graceful degradation to maintain functionality even in error states
- Added detailed logging for easier debugging

## Usage

The CardFrame component can be used in any Phaser scene:

```javascript
// Create a card frame
const cardFrame = new CardFrame(scene, x, y, {
    // Basic information
    characterKey: 'character_Drakarion',
    characterName: 'Drakarion',
    characterType: 'fire',
    characterTeam: 'player',
    
    // Health information
    currentHealth: 100,
    maxHealth: 122,
    
    // Interactivity
    interactive: true,
    onSelect: (card) => {
        console.log(`${card.config.characterName} selected!`);
    }
});
```

## Future Integration Plans

### Phase 1: Battle UI Integration
- Modify CharacterSprite to use the new CardFrame instead of circles
- Update character positioning and scaling approach
- Connect health updates to CardFrame.setHealth()
- Connect selection events to CardFrame.setSelected()

### Phase 2: TeamBuilder UI Integration
- Create equivalent CSS styling for DOM-based TeamBuilder
- Implement consistent card presentation across Battle and TeamBuilder

## Technical Considerations

### Asset Requirements
Before full implementation, the following assets need to be created:
- Frame template with 9-slice compatible corners
- Type variations for all 22 elemental types
- Decorative nameplate assets with beveled edges/scrollwork
- Decorative flourishes for nameplates

### Performance Optimization
- Used proper object pooling and resource management
- Implemented efficient tweening and animation
- Added thorough cleanup in the destroy() method

## Conclusion
The CardFrame component provides a solid foundation for improving the visual presentation of characters throughout the game. It combines professional aesthetics with practical functionality while maintaining the game's type-themed design language. The next step is integration with the existing CharacterSprite system for use in the Battle UI.
