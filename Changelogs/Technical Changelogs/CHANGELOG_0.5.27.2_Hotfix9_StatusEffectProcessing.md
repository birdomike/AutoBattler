# CHANGELOG_0.5.27.2_Hotfix9_StatusEffectProcessing

## Overview
This hotfix addresses critical issues with status effect processing in the battle system. Three main bugs were fixed:

1. **Damage Method Mismatch**: StatusEffectManager was using the deprecated `dealDamage` method instead of the new `applyDamage` method that is part of the refactored component system.
2. **Healing Parameter Order**: Parameter order was incorrect in the healing method, causing null reference errors.
3. **Status Effect Definition Warnings**: Status effects created unnecessary warnings before generating fallbacks.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. StatusEffectManager._processDamageEffect

#### Problem
The `_processDamageEffect` method was calling `this.battleManager.dealDamage` which no longer exists in the refactored BattleManager. This caused the error:
```
TypeError: this.battleManager.dealDamage is not a function
```

#### Solution
Updated the method to use the new `applyDamage` method with the correct parameter order:

```javascript
// BEFORE
this.battleManager.dealDamage(null, character, damage, {
    isTrueDamage: true, // Bypass defense
    source: 'status',
    statusName: definition.name
});

// AFTER
this.battleManager.applyDamage(
    character,         // target
    damage,            // amount
    effect.source,     // source
    null,              // ability (null for status effects)
    effect.id || 'status_effect'  // damageType (use effect.id if available)
);
```

This corrects the method call to match the BattleManager's facade method signature, which passes the call through to the appropriate component.

### 2. StatusEffectManager._processHealingEffect

#### Problem
The parameter order in `applyHealing` calls was incorrect. The first parameter should be the character being healed, but it was being passed as `null`. This caused the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'currentHp')
```
during regeneration healing, as seen in the logs:
```
BattleBridge: applyHealing patched method called with: undefined {id: 3, name: 'Sylvanna', ...} undefined
```

#### Solution
Corrected the parameter order to ensure the character being healed is passed as the first argument:

```javascript
// BEFORE
this.battleManager.applyHealing(null, character, healing, {
    source: 'status',
    statusName: definition.name
});

// AFTER
this.battleManager.applyHealing(
    character,       // target (character being healed)
    healing,         // amount
    effect.source || character, // source (use effect.source or default to self)
    'Regeneration'   // ability name
);
```

This ensures the target parameter (first argument) is correctly set to the character with the regeneration effect.

### 3. StatusEffectDefinitionLoader.getDefinition

#### Problem
The `getDefinition` method would log a warning about missing effect definitions before generating a fallback, leading to unnecessary warnings in the console like:
```
[StatusEffectDefinitionLoader] Effect definition not found for: status_bleed
```
This made the logs harder to read, and the method was generating a new fallback definition every time the same effect was requested.

#### Solution
Refactored the method to immediately generate and cache fallback definitions when they don't exist:

```javascript
// BEFORE
const definition = this.effectDefinitions.get(effectId);

if (!definition) {
    console.warn(`[StatusEffectDefinitionLoader] Effect definition not found for: ${effectId}`);
    
    // Generate a smarter fallback based on the effect ID name
    return this.generateFallbackDefinition(effectId);
}

return definition;

// AFTER
if (!this.effectDefinitions.has(effectId)) {
    // Generate a fallback definition and cache it for future use
    const fallbackDefinition = this.generateFallbackDefinition(effectId);
    this.effectDefinitions.set(effectId, fallbackDefinition);
    
    // Log generation but not as a warning
    console.log(`[StatusEffectDefinitionLoader] Generated and cached fallback definition for: ${effectId}`);
}

return this.effectDefinitions.get(effectId);
```

This approach:
1. Immediately checks if the definition exists using `has()`
2. If not, generates a fallback and caches it for future use
3. Uses a regular log instead of a warning to keep logs cleaner
4. Returns the definition (either original or newly generated and cached)

## Testing

These changes were tested with:

1. A battle involving Sylvanna, who has abilities that apply bleed and regeneration effects
2. Verification that status effects properly apply damage (bleed) and healing (regeneration)
3. Confirmation that battle logs correctly show status effect application and processing
4. Verification that console logs no longer show errors or excessive warnings

These fixes ensure that all status effects work correctly with the refactored component-based architecture.

## Additional Notes

These changes address the immediate issues with status effect processing without requiring significant architectural changes. They maintain compatibility with the ongoing refactoring effort while ensuring stable gameplay.

The changes follow the "defensive programming" approach by:
1. Checking for null/undefined values
2. Using fallbacks and defaults where appropriate
3. Providing clear logging instead of cryptic errors
4. Maintaining backward compatibility
