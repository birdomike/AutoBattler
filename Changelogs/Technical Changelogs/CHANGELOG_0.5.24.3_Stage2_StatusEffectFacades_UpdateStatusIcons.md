# Version 0.5.24.3: Stage 2 - Converting Status Effect Methods to Facades (Step 2)

## Change Summary
Converted the `updateStatusIcons` method in BattleManager.js to a thin facade that delegates to StatusEffectManager. This continues the refactoring of BattleManager into a pure coordination layer by moving specialized functionality to dedicated components.

## Technical Details

### 1. Change Analysis
The original `updateStatusIcons` method was ~150 lines of complex DOM manipulation logic that included:
- Creating and styling status effect icons
- Complex tooltip generation with different formats for each status type
- Dynamic image loading with fallback handling
- Custom HTML structure creation
- CSS class assignment based on effect types
- Special case handling for different status effect categories

The new facade method is only 8 lines and simply delegates to the specialized StatusEffectManager component.

### 2. Changes Made

#### 2.1 Method Signature Unchanged
```javascript
updateStatusIcons(character)
```

The method's signature remained identical to maintain backward compatibility with all existing code that calls this method. Return type documentation was added for clarity.

#### 2.2 Implementation Changed
Before:
```javascript
updateStatusIcons(character) {
    // REFACTORING: Use new implementation if toggle is enabled
    if (this.useNewImplementation && this.statusEffectManager) {
        return this.statusEffectManager.updateStatusIcons(character);
    }
    
    // Original implementation
    // ~150 lines of DOM manipulation logic...
}
```

After:
```javascript
updateStatusIcons(character) {
    // Defensive check
    if (!this.statusEffectManager) {
        console.error("StatusEffectManager not initialized! Cannot update status icons.");
        return false;
    }
    
    // Direct delegation
    return this.statusEffectManager.updateStatusIcons(character);
}
```

### 3. Risk Assessment and Testing

#### 3.1 Risk Factors
- **DOM Manipulation**: The original method contained extensive DOM operations which are now handled by StatusEffectManager. The refactored code must maintain the same visual output and interaction behavior.
- **Tooltip Integration**: The method had custom integration with BattleUI for tooltips, which must be preserved in the StatusEffectManager.
- **Return Value**: The facade now properly returns a boolean for error handling purposes.
- **Defensive Handling**: Added proper error handling if StatusEffectManager is not initialized.

#### 3.2 Testing Strategy
- Verify status effect icons appear correctly on characters
- Test tooltip functionality on status effect icons
- Verify stack count visuals update appropriately
- Confirm different status types use appropriate visual styling and colors
- Test image loading with both existing and nonexistent status icons to verify fallback behavior

### 4. Results
- Successfully removed approximately 142 lines of code from BattleManager.js
- Maintained identical visual functionality for status effect display
- Improved separation of concerns by moving DOM manipulation and visual logic to StatusEffectManager
- Added proper defensive error handling for component initialization issues

### 5. Next Steps
The final status effect method to convert is `processStatusEffects()`, which will complete Stage 2 of the BattleManager refactoring plan.
