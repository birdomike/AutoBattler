# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.7 - CardFrame Circular Reference Fix

## Issue
When debugging the CardFrame character sprite rendering, the console displayed an error: "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" due to an attempt to stringify Phaser objects that contain circular references.

## Root Cause Analysis
In CardFrame.js, specifically within the `createCharacterSprite` method, we were using `JSON.stringify` to log the default frame properties of a texture. Phaser objects inherently contain circular references (sprites reference scenes which reference sprites), making them unsuitable for direct JSON stringification.

The error occurred on this line:
```javascript
console.log(`- Default frame: ${JSON.stringify(texture.frames.__BASE)}`);
```

This is a common issue when working with Phaser objects, as their internal structure often contains back-references that create circular dependencies.

## Changes Made
Modified the logging approach to avoid using `JSON.stringify` on Phaser objects. Instead, we now log specific properties of the frame directly:

```javascript
if (texture.frames && texture.frames.__BASE) {
    const baseFrame = texture.frames.__BASE;
    console.log(`- Default frame properties: width=${baseFrame.width || 'unknown'}, height=${baseFrame.height || 'unknown'}, x=${baseFrame.x || 0}, y=${baseFrame.y || 0}`);
} else {
    console.log(`- Default frame: Not available`);
}
```

This approach:
1. Safely accesses individual properties of the frame object
2. Includes fallback values to prevent undefined errors
3. Provides the same useful information without causing circular reference errors
4. Uses proper null/undefined checking for robustness

## Testing
This fix should eliminate the circular reference error in the console, allowing the debugging process to continue without interruption. The console output now shows specific frame properties rather than attempting to serialize the entire object.

## Next Steps
With this debugging error fixed, we can now:
1. Review the complete console logs without interruption
2. Focus on the actual character art visibility issues
3. Address asset loading for card frames and nameplates
