# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Import Hotfix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a critical module import error with the newly added TurnIndicator component. The fix resolves a path resolution issue and improves the component loading architecture.

## Issues Fixed

### Module Import Error
- Fixed: `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:8083/js/phaser/scenes/js/phaser/components/battle/TurnIndicator.js`
- Fixed: MIME type mismatch error for dynamically imported module

## Implementation Details

### TurnIndicator.js Modifications
- Updated class declaration to use proper ES module export syntax
- Changed from standard class declaration to explicit `export default` declaration
- Maintained all functionality while improving compatibility with ES module system

### BattleScene.js Modifications
- Changed from dynamic `import()` to static `import` at the top of the file
- Fixed path resolution by using proper relative path `../components/battle/TurnIndicator.js`
- Enhanced error handling for TurnIndicator instantiation with explicit try/catch blocks
- Updated version number to reflect TurnIndicator feature and import fix

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Replaced dynamic import with static import, which is more appropriate for a required component
- Improved error handling to provide graceful fallbacks if the component fails to load
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Enhanced version tracking in file headers

## Testing Notes
This hotfix ensures:
1. The TurnIndicator component loads correctly during BattleScene initialization
2. The floor marker appears properly beneath active characters during battle
3. Proper error recovery happens if the component fails to load for any reason

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation used a dynamic `import()` statement with an incorrect path. Dynamic imports in this context were resolving paths relative to the document root rather than relative to the importing file, causing path duplication and resolution failure. 

The static import approach correctly resolves paths relative to the importing file and ensures the component is available before the BattleScene tries to use it.
