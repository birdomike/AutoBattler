## Version 0.5.0.23 - 2025-05-03
### Fixed
- **Character Sprite Rendering Quality**: Resolved persistent pixelation issues with character sprites in Battle Scene
  - Implemented optimized pre-sized character images at exactly 80x120 pixels for combat
  - Created dedicated Combat_Version folder structure for battle-optimized sprites
  - Completely disabled runtime scaling to eliminate WebGL interpolation artifacts
  - Set perfect 1:1 pixel ratio display for all combat-optimized character art
  - Used browser-optimized images instead of relying on WebGL scaling

### Added
- **Multi-Resolution Asset System**: 
  - Added support for context-specific character art with different resolutions
  - Created precisely-sized 80x120px battle-optimized versions of all character sprites
  - Maintained original high-resolution art for TeamBuilder UI

### Technical
- Created new asset path structure: `assets/images/Character Art/Combat_Version/`
- Modified `BattleScene.js` to load the 80x120px optimized character versions
- Updated `CharacterSprite.js` to explicitly set scale to 1.0 for pre-optimized images
- Added special handling for filenames with special characters (e.g., "Riven(Caste).png")
- Added detailed diagnostic logging for image rendering process
