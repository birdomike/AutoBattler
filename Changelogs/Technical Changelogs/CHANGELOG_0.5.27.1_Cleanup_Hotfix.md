# Technical Changelog: v0.5.27.1_Cleanup_Hotfix - PassiveTriggerTracker Syntax Fixes

## Overview
This hotfix addresses critical syntax and indentation errors introduced during the v0.5.27.1_Cleanup implementation that were causing character validation failures in the ActionGenerator component.

## Issue Analysis

During the cleanup of the PassiveTriggerTracker implementation, improper indentation in the edited code resulted in syntax errors that impacted character initialization during battle. Specifically:

1. The `startBattle` method had incorrect indentation in the `this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking()` call
2. The `startNextTurn` method had similar indentation errors and a misplaced closing brace
3. These issues led to validation failures in ActionGenerator with errors:
   - "Character validation failed: missing name property"
   - "Target unknown failed validation, aborting action"

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Indentation in startBattle Method

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
} else {
console.warn("[BattleManager] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset");
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleManager] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset");
}
```

### 2. Fixed Indentation and Structure in startNextTurn Method

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetTurnTracking();
} else {
console.warn("[BattleManager] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for turn reset");
}  // <- Misplaced closing brace
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetTurnTracking();
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleManager] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for turn reset");
}
```

## Testing Notes

- Fixed indentation to proper JavaScript style (4-space standard)
- Ensured proper code block closure
- Verified character validation now works correctly in ActionGenerator
- Maintained same logical behavior while fixing syntax issues

## Implementation Approach

This hotfix used the edit_file MCP tool to make minimal, targeted fixes to the affected code blocks. No behavioral changes were made, only syntax corrections to restore the intended functionality.

## Lessons Learned

- Always verify code indentation and formatting after making edits
- Ensure proper brace matching when changing conditional blocks
- Pay special attention to code that directly affects initialization of battle entities
