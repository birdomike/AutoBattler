# CHANGELOG 0.5.26.1 - AbilityProcessor Implementation

## Overview
This update implements the AbilityProcessor component as part of Stage 5 of the BattleManager refactoring plan. The AbilityProcessor extracts ability-related functionality from the monolithic BattleManager, providing a dedicated component for processing ability effects and executions.

## Technical Changes

### 1. Created AbilityProcessor Component
- Created new component at `js/battle_logic/abilities/AbilityProcessor.js`
- Extracted and implemented three key methods from BattleManager:
  - `applyActionEffect(action)`: Processes ability actions on targets
  - `processEffect(effect, actor, target, ability)`: Handles individual ability effects
  - `applyRandomStatusEffect(target)`: Applies random status effects to targets

### 2. Updated Script Loading in index.html
- Added AbilityProcessor script tag in index.html before BattleManager
- Added proper dependency ordering comments
- Ensured HealingProcessor is loaded properly

### 3. Updated BattleManager Initialization
- Added AbilityProcessor initialization in `initializeComponentManagers()`
- Added verification logging for AbilityProcessor methods
- Updated `useNewImplementation` flag to include AbilityProcessor availability

### 4. Added Toggle Mechanism for Ability Methods
- Updated BattleManager methods to delegate to AbilityProcessor when toggle is enabled:
  - `applyActionEffect(action)`
  - `processEffect(effect, actor, target, ability)`
  - `applyRandomStatusEffect(target)`
- Maintained backward compatibility with original implementation

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Management
The AbilityProcessor relies on several other refactored components:
- StatusEffectManager for status effect handling
- DamageCalculator for damage calculations
- HealingProcessor for healing effects

### Event Dispatching
Special attention was given to ensure all events are properly dispatched:
- CHARACTER_DAMAGED: When damage is applied to a character
- CHARACTER_HEALED: When healing is applied to a character
- STATUS_EFFECT_APPLIED: When a status effect is applied

### Error Handling
Added defensive checks throughout AbilityProcessor implementation:
- Component availability checks before using dependencies
- Parameter validation for all public methods
- Error handling for event dispatching

### Testing Notes
This implementation supports feature toggling for A/B testing:
1. Toggle can be enabled/disabled via `battleManager.toggleImplementation()`
2. When enabled, the new AbilityProcessor handles all ability processing
3. When disabled, the original BattleManager methods are used

## Next Steps
- Complete verification and testing
- Clean up original implementation in BattleManager.js (v0.5.26.1_Cleanup)
- Proceed to TargetingSystem implementation (v0.5.26.2)
