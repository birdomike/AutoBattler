# CHANGELOG 0.5.24c: Battle Turn Indicator Refactoring

## Problem Analysis

The turn indicator system had a fundamental flaw in its design. It was being triggered by the `TURN_STARTED` event, which only fires once per turn when the first character with the highest initiative begins their action. This resulted in the turn indicator (both the floor marker and the UI text) remaining fixed on that first character throughout the entire turn, even as other characters performed their actions.

### Requirements
- The floor marker and UI text should dynamically update to reflect the character that is **currently executing an action**
- The highlight should move between characters as different characters take their turns
- The text should properly update with "[Character]'s Action" for each acting character

## Implementation Overview

The solution involved shifting the turn indicator update logic from the `TURN_STARTED` event to the `CHARACTER_ACTION` event, which fires immediately before each character's action is applied in `BattleFlowController.executeNextAction`.

### Key Changes

1. **Separated Turn Number Updates from Character Highlighting**:
   - Modified `handleTurnStarted()` to only update the turn number display
   - Created separate UI update responsibilities between turn number and character action

2. **Event Handler Modification**:
   - Added explicit `CHARACTER_ACTION` event listener in `setupCoreEventListeners()`
   - Configured it to call `updateActiveCharacterVisuals()` with the currently acting character

3. **UI Text Update Separation**:
   - Modified `updateTurnNumberDisplay()` to handle only turn number updates
   - Ensured `updateActionTextDisplay()` handles the character-specific UI text

4. **Removed Obsolete Methods**:
   - Removed the no-longer-needed `showTurnIndicator()` method which was previously linked to turn starts

## Code Changes

### 1. Modified `setupCoreEventListeners()`:
```javascript
// Listen for TURN_STARTED events - only update turn number, not character highlight
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
    this.handleTurnStarted(data); // Call the handler (now only updates turn number)
});

// Listen for CHARACTER_ACTION events to update which character is active
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_ACTION, (data) => {
    console.log(`[BattleScene] >>> CHARACTER_ACTION Event Received. Character: ${data.character?.name} (Team: ${data.character?.team})`);
    this.updateActiveCharacterVisuals(data.character); // Update indicators for currently acting character
});
```

### 2. Modified `handleTurnStarted()`:
```javascript
// Update the turn number portion of the UI text - no longer handles turn indicator
this.updateTurnNumberDisplay(this.battleState.currentTurn);
```

### 3. Leveraged Existing `updateActiveCharacterVisuals()`:
The existing method already handled properly:
- Clearing turn indicators from both teams
- Finding the correct team container for the acting character
- Showing the turn indicator for the correct character sprite
- Updating the UI text for the current character's action
- Showing the floor marker at the character's position

### 4. Modified `onTurnStarted()`:
```javascript
onTurnStarted(data) {
    try {
        console.log(`Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
        
        // Update battle state
        this.battleState.currentTurn = data.turnNumber;
        this.battleState.activeCharacter = data.currentCharacter;
        
        // Update the turn number only - don't set active character visuals here
        this.updateTurnNumberDisplay(data.turnNumber);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error handling turn started event:', error);
    }
}
```

## Testing Notes

To verify the fix works correctly:
1. Start a battle with multiple characters on each team
2. Observe that the floor indicator correctly moves to each character as they take their actions
3. Verify the UI text at the top updates with the correct character name for each action
4. Ensure the turn number increases properly at the start of each new turn
5. Check that both player and enemy character indicators work correctly

## Effect on Performance

The change should have negligible performance impact:
- No additional events are being created, just redirecting existing ones
- The animation and UI updates already existed, just now triggered at different times
- No additional DOM elements or Phaser objects are created

## Notes for Future Maintenance

This change reinforces the event-driven architecture of the battle system. Character highlighting is now properly tied to the `CHARACTER_ACTION` event, which is a more accurate representation of the battle flow. This makes the codebase more maintainable as it follows the principle that UI updates should be triggered by the events they visually represent.
