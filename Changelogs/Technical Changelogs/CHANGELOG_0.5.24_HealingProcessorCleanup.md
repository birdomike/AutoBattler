# CHANGELOG 0.5.24: HealingProcessor Cleanup

## Summary
Removed the feature toggle and legacy code paths related to healing logic in BattleFlowController.js, completing the Stage 4 refactoring for the HealingProcessor component.

## Implementation Details

### BattleFlowController.js Changes
- Removed the if/else toggle structure (`if (this.battleManager.useNewImplementation && this.battleManager.healingProcessor)`) from the healing ability code block
- Kept only the refactored code path that calls `this.battleManager.healingProcessor.applyHealing()` and uses its return values
- Maintained the defensive check for the HealingProcessor component existence
- Simplified variable declarations by using `const` instead of `let` for the result values, which are no longer reassigned
- Added a clearer comment about exiting early if the component is missing

### BattleManager.js Status
- Verified that the original `applyHealing` and `checkAndResetDeathStatus` methods have already been removed from BattleManager.js in earlier refactoring steps
- The `calculateDamage` and `calculateTypeMultiplier` methods in BattleManager.js have already been refactored to delegate to their respective components

## Technical Notes
With these changes, all healing logic now permanently resides in the dedicated HealingProcessor component, eliminating the toggle mechanism that allowed switching between old and new implementations. This completes Stage 4 of the refactoring plan for the healing system.

The HealingProcessor component (`js/battle_logic/damage/HealingProcessor.js`) is now the single source of truth for healing functionality, maintaining a clean separation of concerns:
- `applyHealing()` handles applying healing to characters and determining if they were revived
- `checkAndResetDeathStatus()` handles properly resetting a character's defeated status if they're healed back from 0 HP

All dependent systems (like passive ability triggers for healing) now work directly with the HealingProcessor's outputs.
