# Changelog: Hero Card Enhancement

## Version 0.6.7.3 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update enhances the visual presentation of hero cards in the TeamBuilder UI by implementing larger cards in a 2-column layout, with character artwork prominently displayed. This change significantly improves the visual appeal of the character selection interface by showcasing the detailed character artwork.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Grid Layout Changes
```css
#heroes-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Changed from 3 to 2 columns */
    gap: 20px; /* Increased from 15px for better spacing */
    width: 100%;
}
```
The change from 3 columns to 2 columns allows for significantly larger hero cards while maintaining the overall UI layout.

#### 2. Card Layout Restructuring
```css
.hero-card-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; /* Changed from row to column */
    align-items: center;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: visible;
}

.hero-card-text {
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
The card content layout was changed from horizontal (icon beside text) to vertical (icon above text), providing more space for both the character art and text elements.

#### 3. Character Art Enhancement
```javascript
// Scale up the art by about 40% for the new larger cards
if (artSettings.width) {
    const originalWidth = parseInt(artSettings.width);
    if (!isNaN(originalWidth)) {
        artSettings.width = `${Math.round(originalWidth * 1.4)}px`;
    }
}

if (artSettings.height) {
    const originalHeight = parseInt(artSettings.height);
    if (!isNaN(originalHeight)) {
        artSettings.height = `${Math.round(originalHeight * 1.4)}px`;
    }
}
```
This code in `TeamBuilderImageLoader.js` dynamically scales character artwork by 40%, maintaining aspect ratios while making art significantly more visible.

#### 4. Card Size Improvements
```css
.hero-card {
    padding: 20px; /* Increased from 15px */
    border-radius: 10px; /* Slightly larger radius */
    min-height: 220px; /* Ensure consistent height */
}

.hero-avatar-container {
    width: 100px; /* Increased from 60px */
    min-height: 100px; /* Increased from 60px */
}
```
Increased card size and padding creates a more spacious layout that gives prominence to character visuals.

#### 5. Custom Scrollbar Styling
```css
#available-heroes {
    scrollbar-width: thin; /* For Firefox */
    scrollbar-color: #3742fa #232a40; /* For Firefox */
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 8px;
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    background: #232a40;
    border-radius: 4px;
}

#available-heroes::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: #3742fa;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```
Added custom scrollbar styling to maintain visual consistency with the game's theme while ensuring good usability.

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Character Art Positioning
One challenge was ensuring proper positioning of character art in the new layout. We addressed this by:
- Scaling art size dynamically while maintaining aspect ratios
- Centering art in the larger containers
- Ensuring vertical alignment worked well for all character sprites

#### 2. Card Height Consistency
To maintain a visually pleasing grid even with varying content sizes:
- Added a `min-height` property to cards
- Used flexbox alignment to position content consistently
- Centered text below character art

#### 3. Scrollbar Aesthetics
With larger cards, scrolling became more necessary, so we:
- Added custom scrollbar styling to match the game theme
- Used thin scrollbars to minimize visual intrusion
- Applied consistent scrollbar styling across containers

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Character Art Prominence**: Characters are now much more visually recognizable with artwork 40% larger than before.

2. **Visual Hierarchy**: The new vertical layout creates a clear visual flow:
   - Character art as the primary focus
   - Character name as secondary focus
   - Type and role information as tertiary focus

3. **Readability**: Text elements now have more horizontal space and improved spacing between elements.

4. **Consistent Sizing**: All cards now have consistent height regardless of content length.

5. **Theme Consistency**: Custom scrollbars maintain the game's visual theme instead of using default browser scrollbars.

### Future Considerations

1. **Performance Testing**: With larger images, we should monitor performance to ensure smooth scrolling on all devices.

2. **Art Resolution**: Some character art may benefit from higher resolution versions to display well at the larger size.

3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Future updates could consider responsive sizing based on screen resolution.

4. **Hover Effects**: Enhanced hover effects could be added to further improve the user experience with the larger cards.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Impact vs. Density**: The tradeoff between showing more heroes at once versus showcasing each hero better was worthwhile for improving the game's visual appeal.

2. **Layout Consistency**: Maintaining consistent card dimensions created a more polished look, even though it required more vertical scrolling.

3. **CSS Organization**: The component-based approach to CSS made these layout changes easier to implement without breaking other parts of the UI.

4. **Asset Scaling**: Dynamically scaling artwork proved more maintainable than creating new art assets for different UI contexts.
