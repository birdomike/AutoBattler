# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.8 - CardFrame Component Visibility Fixes

## Issue
After implementing earlier fixes for the CardFrame component (v0.7.0.5, v0.7.0.6, v0.7.0.7), we attempted to clean up debugging code and restore normal functionality. However, when reverting to standard code, character sprites disappeared completely from the CardFrame, despite being visible with debug settings.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through systematic testing, we isolated the specific component that was causing the visibility issue: **the mask application system**. When the character sprites were placed in the CardFrame with masking enabled, they became invisible.

The key insights from our investigation:
1. Characters were fully visible with debugging settings that included:
   - Center positioning (0,0)
   - Enlarged scale (2x)
   - High depth value (1000)
   - **Disabled masking**
   - Red tinting (for visibility testing)

2. When we attempted to revert to normal settings with masking enabled, characters disappeared completely.

3. Through incremental testing (re-enabling one feature at a time), we confirmed that applying the portrait mask was solely responsible for making the characters invisible.

This indicates a misalignment between the mask geometry and the character sprite positioning - the mask is likely not properly aligned with where the character sprites are being positioned, causing them to be cropped out completely.

## Changes Made
Based on our findings, we made the following targeted adjustments to the CardFrame component:

1. **Mask Application**:
   - Deliberately kept masking disabled to ensure character visibility
   - Added explicit comments to document that masking is intentionally disabled

2. **Visual Appearance**:
   - Removed the red tint debugging visualization
   - Changed scale from fixed value 2 to using the configurable `this.config.artScale`
   - Kept characters centered at (0,0) for consistent positioning
   - Maintained high depth value (1000) to ensure visibility

3. **Preserved Debug Context**:
   - Kept the debugging structure with 7 steps for future troubleshooting
   - Maintained detailed logging of the creation process
   - Fixed circular reference error from previous version

## Current State of CardFrame
The CardFrame component now displays characters correctly with:
- Normal coloration (no red tint)
- Configurable scaling via `artScale`
- No mask applied (intentionally disabled)
- Center positioning at (0,0)
- High depth value (1000)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Incremental Testing is Invaluable**: By testing one change at a time, we quickly identified the specific issue (masking) without having to guess among multiple changes.

2. **Masking Requires Precise Alignment**: The Phaser masking system requires exact alignment between the mask and the content being masked. Any misalignment can result in the content being completely invisible.

3. **Debugging Code Value**: While we typically aim to remove debug code from production, in this case, maintaining some aspects of the debugging approach (disabled masking, positioning, depth) was necessary to ensure proper functionality.

4. **Visual Debugging Tools**: The use of visual aids (like red tinting) proved extremely valuable for diagnosing rendering issues by making it obvious when sprites were correctly loaded but improperly displayed.

## Next Steps
1. **Mask Alignment Investigation**: For future improvements, investigate proper alignment between the portrait mask and character sprites.

2. **Portrait Positioning**: Once masking is properly implemented, transition from center positioning (0,0) to proper portrait offset positioning.

3. **Asset Loading**: Ensure proper loading of card frame and nameplate textures in BattleAssetLoader.

4. **Depth Value Refinement**: Gradually reduce depth value from 1000 to more reasonable 100 once other visualization issues are resolved.

While the masking functionality is currently disabled, this approach maintains component usability while providing clear documentation of the known issue for future resolution.
