# CHANGELOG 0.6.6.2 - TeamBuilderUI Refactoring: Fixing Missed References

## Overview

This update fixes a critical error that occurred after completing the Remove stage of Phase 1 in the TeamBuilderUI refactoring. The error was caused by missed references to original utility methods that were removed but not properly replaced with calls to TeamBuilderUtils.

## Bug Description

After deploying version 0.6.6.1, users encountered the following error when attempting to view hero details:

```
Uncaught TypeError: this.splitTypes is not a function
    at TeamBuilderUI.renderHeroDetails (TeamBuilderUI.js:816:32)
    at TeamBuilderUI.selectHeroDetails (TeamBuilderUI.js:1586:18)
    at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (TeamBuilderUI.js:372:59)
```

This error occurred because while we removed the `splitTypes` method from TeamBuilderUI.js, we missed updating two specific calls to `this.splitTypes()` in the codebase:

1. In the `renderHeroDetails()` method:
   ```javascript
   // Get all hero types
   const heroTypes = this.splitTypes(hero.type);
   ```

2. In the `updateExistingHeroDetails()` method:
   ```javascript
   // For multiple types, use the first type's color for the background
   const heroTypes = this.splitTypes(hero.type);
   ```

Additionally, we found more missed references to `this.createStatBox()` in the `updateExistingHeroDetails()` method that also needed to be updated.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed References to `splitTypes`

Updated both missed references to use TeamBuilderUtils:

```javascript
// Before
const heroTypes = this.splitTypes(hero.type);

// After
const heroTypes = TeamBuilderUtils.splitTypes(hero.type);
```

### 2. Fixed References to `createStatBox`

Updated all calls to `this.createStatBox()` within `updateExistingHeroDetails()`:

```javascript
// Before
const hpStat = this.createStatBox('HP', hero.stats.hp, 'Health Points - How much damage a character can take before being defeated');
// ... and similar calls for other stats

// After
const hpStat = TeamBuilderUtils.createStatBox('HP', hero.stats.hp, 'Health Points - How much damage a character can take before being defeated');
// ... and similar updates for other stats
```

## Testing Verification

After implementing these fixes, we verified that:

1. The error "Uncaught TypeError: this.splitTypes is not a function" no longer occurs
2. Selecting a hero correctly displays their details in the hero details panel
3. Multi-type heroes (like Aqualia with "water/ice") display correctly with proper type separation
4. All stat boxes are displayed with correct tooltips

## Lessons Learned

1. **Thorough Reference Checking**: When refactoring code using the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern, it's important to perform thorough searches for all references to the methods being removed, including those in less obvious places like nested methods.

2. **Method Usage Patterns**: Methods like `splitTypes` were called in multiple contexts:
   - Directly in UI rendering methods
   - Within update methods for existing UI elements
   - In utility functions that manipulate data

3. **Enhanced Testing After Removal**: After removing original methods, it's critical to test all user flows again with special attention to areas that might have missed references.

4. **Effective Use of Error Reports**: The specific error message and stack trace was invaluable in identifying exactly where the missed references were located.

## Moving Forward

With these fixes in place, the Remove stage of Phase 1 is now truly complete. This experience will inform our approach to the later phases, specifically:

1. We'll perform more thorough scanning for method references before removing methods
2. We'll implement more extensive testing for each component after removal
3. We'll be especially careful with utility methods that might be called from multiple contexts

The next phase (Phase 2: HeroDetailPanelManager) can now proceed with confidence that the foundation is solid.
