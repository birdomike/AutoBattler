# Technical Changelog: Version 0.6.3.19 - Diagnostic Code Cleanup

## Overview
This release removes temporary diagnostic debugging statements that were previously added for troubleshooting specific issues. These statements were cluttering the console output and were no longer needed after the issues had been fixed.

## Files Modified
1. `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\js\phaser\bridge\BattleBridge.js`
2. `C:\Personal\AutoBattler\js\phaser\components\battle\CharacterSprite.js`

## Detailed Changes

### BattleBridge.js

#### Changes
- Removed the "TEMP DIAGNOSTIC" console.log statements in the `dispatchEvent` method
- Removed verbose listener diagnostics that were printing detailed information about each listener
- Removed process debugging in `applyActionEffect` and `processAbility` patch methods
- Updated version from 0.5.1.2d to 0.5.1.3d

#### Before
The `dispatchEvent` method contained multiple debugging outputs:
```javascript
dispatchEvent(eventType, data) {
    // TEMP DIAGNOSTIC - DELETE AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING
    console.log('[BB dispatchEvent CALLED] EventType:', eventType, 'Data Keys:', data ? Object.keys(data) : 'No data', 'Raw Data (beware circular):', data);
    
    console.log(`BattleBridge: Dispatching event ${eventType}`, data);
    
    // Log listener count for debugging
    console.log(`BattleBridge: Found ${this.eventListeners[eventType].length} listeners for ${eventType}`);
    
    // TEMP DIAGNOSTIC - DELETE AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING
    if (this.eventListeners[eventType] && this.eventListeners[eventType].length > 0) { 
        console.log('[BB dispatchEvent] Registered callbacks for ' + eventType + ':', 
            this.eventListeners[eventType].map(cb => cb.name || 'anonymous_handler')); 
    }
    
    // More verbose diagnostic logging...
}
```

#### After
The `dispatchEvent` method now contains only essential logging:
```javascript
dispatchEvent(eventType, data) {
    console.log(`BattleBridge: Dispatching event ${eventType}`, data);
    
    if (!this.eventListeners[eventType]) {
        console.warn(`BattleBridge: No listeners for event "${eventType}"`);
        return;
    }
    
    // Continue with event dispatching without verbose diagnostics
}
```

### CharacterSprite.js

#### Changes
- Removed the "TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG" console.log statements in the `updateHealth` and `updateHealthBar` methods
- Removed excessive diagnostic logging in the `showAttackAnimation` method
- Removed unnecessary position tracking and character proximity checks in attack animations
- Improved error messages to be more consistent in formatting

#### Before
The health methods contained diagnostic statements:
```javascript
updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth) {
    // TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
    // TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
    console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] CharacterSprite.updateHealth called for ${this.character?.name}, HP: ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
    // END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
    
    // Regular implementation code...
    
    // TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE - HEALTH BAR BUG
    // TODO: REMOVE or MOVE after bug fix / refactoring
    console.log(`[HEALTH DEBUG] CharacterSprite.updateHealth calling updateHealthBar for ${this.character?.name}`);
    // END TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE
}
```

#### After
The health methods now contain only essential logging:
```javascript
updateHealth(newHealth, maxHealth) {
    console.log(`CharacterSprite.updateHealth: ${this.character?.name} health to ${newHealth}/${maxHealth}`);
    
    // Regular implementation code without diagnostic statements
}
```

The `showAttackAnimation` method was also streamlined to remove extensive diagnostic logs about global coordinates, character proximity, and potential targeting issues, which were initially added for troubleshooting animation targeting bugs.

## Rationale
These changes were made for the following reasons:

1. **Code Clarity**: Removing temporary diagnostic code improves code readability and maintainability.
2. **Console Performance**: Reducing console output improves browser performance, especially during complex battles where these messages were appearing frequently.
3. **Cleanup After Bug Fixes**: The diagnostic code was added to help fix specific bugs that have now been resolved, making the diagnostic code unnecessary.
4. **Standardized Logging**: The remaining logs follow a more consistent format.

## Impact
These changes have no functional impact on the game's operation, but improve the developer experience by:

1. Making the console output cleaner and easier to read
2. Reducing client-side performance overhead from excessive logging
3. Making the codebase easier to maintain by removing temporary code

## Testing
The game was tested with a variety of battle scenarios to ensure that removing the diagnostic code did not affect functionality:

1. Multiple battle rounds with different team compositions
2. Various ability triggers and effects
3. Attack animations between characters
4. Health updates and battle log display

No issues were observed after removing the diagnostic code.
