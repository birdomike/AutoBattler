# Version 0.6.3.2 - Turn Indicator and Action Text Diagnostics

## Overview
Added additional diagnostic logs to help troubleshoot why turn highlighting (floor markers and character glow) and action indicators (text above character's head) are not functioning properly during battle.

## Changes

### BattleScene.js (v0.6.2.3)
- Enhanced `initializeEventManager()` method with more detailed diagnostic logs:
  - Added `[BattleScene.initializeEventManager] >>> About to create BattleEventManager instance.` immediately before BattleEventManager instantiation
  - Added `[BattleScene.initializeEventManager] <<< BattleEventManager instance supposedly created. this.eventManager is: [object]` immediately after instantiation

### BattleEventManager.js (v0.6.2.3)
- Modified constructor log to: `[BEM Constructor] === CONSTRUCTOR FIRST LINE ===`
- Modified initialize method log to: `[BEM initialize] === INITIALIZE FIRST LINE ===`

## Technical Details
These diagnostic logs are designed to track the exact moment and order of execution during BattleEventManager creation and initialization. By placing logs at the very beginning of these methods, we can determine if these methods are being entered at all during the expected battle initialization flow.

The primary goal is to understand why BattleEventManager doesn't appear to be properly instantiated or why its event listeners for CHARACTER_ACTION and ABILITY_USED are not responding. 

## Next Steps
After testing with these diagnostic logs:
1. If BattleEventManager logs don't appear at all: investigate why BattleScene's initializeEventManager isn't running or why BattleEventManager instantiation is failing
2. If BattleEventManager logs appear but ACTION_CHARACTER events aren't triggering: investigate the event dispatch mechanism in BattleBridge or BattleFlowController
