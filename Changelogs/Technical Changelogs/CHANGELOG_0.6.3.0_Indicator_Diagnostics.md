# Changelog - Version 0.6.3.0 - Indicator Diagnostics

## Overview

This update adds comprehensive diagnostic logging to the Turn Highlighting and Action Indicator systems to help identify and resolve issues with visual feedback during battle. The diagnostic logs trace the complete event flow from event triggers through component handoffs to visual updates.

## Files Modified

1. `js/phaser/core/BattleEventManager.js`
2. `js/phaser/managers/TeamDisplayManager.js`
3. `js/phaser/components/battle/TeamContainer.js`
4. `js/phaser/components/battle/CharacterSprite.js`
5. `js/phaser/components/battle/ActionIndicator.js`

## Detailed Changes

### BattleEventManager.js

Added diagnostic logging to track event flow for Turn Highlighting and Action Indicators:

- In `onCharacterAction(data)`:
  - Added log at entry point showing the CHARACTER_ACTION event data
  - Added log showing teamManager availability before updateActiveCharacterVisuals call
  - Added log to trace CharacterSprite resolution for "Auto Attack" text display
  - Added log showing if CharacterSprite was found or null

- In `onAbilityUsed(data)`:
  - Added log at entry point showing ABILITY_USED event data including character and ability info
  - Added log showing if CharacterSprite was found or null

### TeamDisplayManager.js

Added diagnostics to track Turn Highlighting processing:

- In `updateActiveCharacterVisuals(characterData)`:
  - Enhanced logging to clearly identify method call for Turn Highlighting
  - Added log showing attempts to clear indicators on TeamContainers
  - Added log showing which team container receives the showTurnIndicator call

### TeamContainer.js

Enhanced with diagnostic logs for Team Container operations:

- In `showTurnIndicator(identifier)`:
  - Added log at entry point showing identification string or number
  - Added log showing if CharacterSprite was found or null before calling highlight

- In `clearTurnIndicators()`:
  - Added log showing which team (player/enemy) is clearing indicators

- Added new `clearAllHighlights()` method with appropriate logging:
  - Was referenced in TeamDisplayManager but missing in implementation
  - Added log showing which team (player/enemy) is clearing highlight effects

### CharacterSprite.js

Added diagnostic logs for character state visualization:

- In `showActionText(actionText)`:
  - Added log showing character name, action text, and actionIndicator availability

- In `highlight()`:
  - Added detailed log of initial visual state (highlight visibility, alpha values, etc.)
  - Added log after visual creation/updates, just before tweens start

### ActionIndicator.js

Added diagnostics for action text display:

- In `showAction(actionText, options)`:
  - Added log showing text, current text object state, and alpha values

## Diagnostic Flow

The diagnostic logs follow two primary flows:

### Turn Highlighting Flow:
1. `CHARACTER_ACTION` event emitted
2. `BattleEventManager.onCharacterAction()` receives event 
3. `TeamDisplayManager.updateActiveCharacterVisuals()` is called
4. `TeamContainer.showTurnIndicator()` is called for appropriate team
5. `CharacterSprite.highlight()` is called for targeted character

### Action Indicator Flow:
1. `CHARACTER_ACTION` or `ABILITY_USED` event emitted
2. `BattleEventManager.onCharacterAction()` or `onAbilityUsed()` receive event
3. `CharacterSprite.showActionText()` is called with action text
4. `ActionIndicator.showAction()` is called to display and animate text

## Expected Diagnostic Output

The diagnostics will show:

1. If event handlers are being called
2. If required component references are defined/undefined
3. If character sprites are being found correctly
4. If highlight/text effects are being created with correct parameters
5. The state of visual elements before they're manipulated

## Purpose and Usage

These diagnostics will help identify issues in the Turn Highlighting and Action Indicator systems by showing:

- Missing component references
- Failed character sprite resolution
- Visual state issues (invisible or improperly positioned elements)
- Tween/animation initiation failures
- Incorrect or missing event data

### How to Analyze Logs:
1. Look for "undefined" or "null" in component references
2. Check if CharacterSprite is consistently not being found
3. Verify the state of visual elements
4. Confirm complete event flow from trigger to final visual update

Once the issue is identified, these diagnostic logs can be removed or commented out in a future update.
