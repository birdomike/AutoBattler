# Technical Changelog 0.6.3.0 - Battle Visual Indicator Diagnostics

## Overview

This technical update adds comprehensive diagnostic instrumentation across multiple components to help diagnose issues with battle visual indicators, specifically:

1. Turn Highlighting (floor marker/glow for active character)
2. Action Indicators (text above character's head when performing actions)

The diagnostics have been implemented as a temporary measure to help identify why these visual elements aren't appearing during battle.

## Implementation Details

### BattleBridge.js Changes

- Enhanced `dispatchEvent` method with detailed diagnostic logging:
  - Added complete event listener count information for all registered event types
  - Added detailed logging for action-related events (`CHARACTER_ACTION` and `ABILITY_USED`)
  - Added extensive logging of event handler information including function type, binding context, and function source

```javascript
// When dispatching events, show event listener summary
if (eventType === 'character_action' || eventType === 'ability_used') {
    console.log('BattleBridge: Event listeners summary:', Object.entries(this.eventListeners).map(([type, listeners]) => {
        return `${type}: ${listeners.length} listeners`;
    }));
}

// Provide detailed information about event handlers
console.log(`BattleBridge: Calling listener ${index} for ${eventType}`, {
    listenerFunction: typeof callback,
    listenerThisContext: callback.hasOwnProperty('this') ? 'has this context' : 'no this context',
    listenerToString: callback.toString().substring(0, 100) + '...'
});
```

- Enhanced `applyActionEffect` method with diagnostic reporting:
  - Added detailed validation of event type existence
  - Added event data structure verification
  - Added listener count checking

### BattleEventManager.js Changes

- Added initialization diagnostics to constructor:
  - BattleBridge availability verification
  - Event types availability checking
  - addEventListener method validation

```javascript
console.log("[BattleEventManager] Initializing with battleBridge:", {
    hasBattleBridge: !!this.battleBridge,
    eventTypesAvailable: this.battleBridge && this.battleBridge.eventTypes ? Object.keys(this.battleBridge.eventTypes) : 'none',
    hasAddEventListener: this.battleBridge && typeof this.battleBridge.addEventListener === 'function'
});
```

- Enhanced event registration with validation:
  - Added detailed logging of registered event types
  - Added handler binding verification
  - Added event handler registration confirmation
  - Added battleBridge listener count verification

### BattleScene.js Changes

- Added diagnostic logging to `initializeEventManager`:
  - BattleBridge availability checking
  - BattleEventManager class availability verification
  - Event type structure validation
  - Event handler method verification

```javascript
console.log('BattleScene.initializeEventManager: BattleEventManager created:', {
    instanceCreated: !!this.eventManager,
    hasOnCharacterAction: typeof this.eventManager?.onCharacterAction === 'function',
    hasOnAbilityUsed: typeof this.eventManager?.onAbilityUsed === 'function'
});
```

- Added direct test method for manual indicator testing:
  - `testTurnHighlightingDirectly()` - Bypasses event system to test indicators directly
  - Function made globally available via window object

### ActionIndicator.js Changes

- Added diagnostic logging in constructor and methods:
  - Character validation in constructor
  - Enhanced showAction method with parent information
  - Container validation and state reporting

```javascript
console.log(`ActionIndicator constructor called for character: ${parent?.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);

console.log(`ActionIndicator.showAction: Called with text: '${actionText}' for character: ${this.parent?.character?.name || 'unknown'}. Text object state: content=${this.text ? this.text.text : 'undefined'}, alpha=${this.text ? this.text.alpha : 'undefined'}, visible=${this.text ? (this.text.visible ? 'true' : 'false') : 'undefined'}. Parent container exists: ${this.parent?.container ? 'yes' : 'no'}. Tween starting.`);
```

## Debugging Strategy

These diagnostic changes enable a multi-layered approach to troubleshooting:

1. **Event Dispatching**: Verify events are properly dispatched from BattleBridge with correct data
2. **Event Registration**: Confirm event handlers are properly registered with BattleBridge
3. **Handler Binding**: Ensure event handlers have proper 'this' context binding
4. **Component Availability**: Validate all required components exist and are properly initialized
5. **Visual Component Function**: Test visual components directly, bypassing the event system

## Manual Testing Approach

A global `testTurnHighlightingDirectly()` function has been added to allow direct testing of visual indicators through the browser console. This provides a way to verify if the components themselves are working correctly without relying on the event system.

This function:
1. Gets a test character from the player team
2. Directly calls TeamDisplayManager.updateActiveCharacterVisuals()
3. Directly finds the character sprite and calls sprite.showActionText()

## Next Steps

After identifying the root cause of the visual indicator issues:

1. Remove diagnostic logging to keep code clean
2. Fix the identified issue
3. Update the changelog to document the fix with appropriate version number
