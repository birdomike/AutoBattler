# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.5 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Investigation: Turn Indicator Floor Marker Not Displaying

This update adds strategic diagnostics across the event chain to trace the `TURN_STARTED` event flow from BattleManager through BattleBridge to BattleScene's TurnIndicator component.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleManager.js 
**Function**: `startNextTurn()`

```javascript
startNextTurn() {
    if (!this.battleActive || this.isPaused || this.turnInProgress) return;
    
    this.currentTurn++;
    console.log('[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...'); // ADDED LINE
    this.logMessage(`Turn ${this.currentTurn} started`, 'info');
    this.turnInProgress = true;
```

**Purpose**: Identify whether the TURN_STARTED event dispatch is being attempted at battle turn start.

#### 2. BattleBridge.js
**Function**: `patchBattleManager()` â†’ `startTurn` patch

```javascript
this.battleManager.startTurn = function() {
    console.log('BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called');
    const result = originalStartTurn.apply(this, arguments);
    const currentChar = this.currentCharacter || {};
    console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar.name);
    console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.'); // ADDED LINE
    self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
        currentCharacter: this.currentCharacter,
        turnNumber: this.turnNumber
    });
    return result;
};
```

**Purpose**: Verify that BattleBridge's patched version of startTurn is being called and is attempting to dispatch the TURN_STARTED event.

#### 3. BattleScene.js
**Location 1**: `setupCoreEventListeners()` method

```javascript
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
    console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
    console.log('[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.'); // ADDED LINE
    this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
});
```

**Purpose**: Confirm that the TURN_STARTED listener has been successfully registered in BattleScene.

**Location 2**: `handleTurnStarted(eventData)` method

```javascript
handleTurnStarted(eventData) {
    console.log('[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data:', eventData); // ADDED LINE
    console.log('Event: TURN_STARTED', eventData);
    
    // Get the new active character
    const newActiveCharacter = eventData.character;
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the handleTurnStarted method is being called and receiving the expected event data structure.

### Expected Diagnostic Flow

1. When a turn starts, we should see:
   - `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...` in console
   - `BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called` (if the patch is working)
   - `[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.` (before dispatch)
   - `[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.` (if listener receives event)
   - `[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data: {...}` (if method is invoked)

2. If any log is missing from this chain, it indicates where the event flow is breaking down:
   - Missing first log: BattleManager's startNextTurn isn't being called
   - Missing second log: BattleBridge's patch isn't working
   - Missing third log: BattleBridge isn't dispatching the event
   - Missing fourth log: BattleScene's listener isn't being called
   - Missing fifth log: handleTurnStarted method isn't being invoked

### Potential Issues to Look For

- Event name mismatch between dispatcher and listener
- Event data structure differences affecting expectations
- Missing bridge initialization or incomplete patching
- Timing issues where listeners aren't set up when events are dispatched
- Incorrect property names in event data (e.g., `character` vs `currentCharacter`)
