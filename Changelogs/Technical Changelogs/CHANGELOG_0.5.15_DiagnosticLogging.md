## Version 0.5.15 - 2025-05-18
### Added
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to diagnose BattleFlowController issues
  - Added detailed logging in BattleManager.startNextTurn() to track method availability at delegation time
  - Added extended logging immediately after BattleFlowController instantiation to verify initial state
  - Included type checks for critical controller methods (startNextTurn, executeNextAction, finishTurn)
  - Created complete instance inspection to identify potential prototype issues

### Technical
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added console.log statements in BattleManager.startNextTurn() to diagnose undefined method error
  - Added immediate post-instantiation logging to verify BattleFlowController's methods are present when created
  - Included object inspection logs to identify potential loss of prototype methods
  - Enhanced logging includes both the object instance and its method types
  - Maintained the same functional code while adding non-intrusive diagnostics

### Debugging Approach
These logging enhancements are designed to help diagnose the timing and cause of the "this.battleFlowController.startNextTurn is not a function" error by:
1. Determining if methods exist immediately after object creation
2. Checking if methods disappear between creation and invocation
3. Verifying typeof checks for critical controller methods
4. Providing visibility into potential prototype chain issues
5. Comparing state at different stages of execution to identify when methods become undefined

The logs were added at strategic points that should reveal whether the issue is related to:
- Incorrect object instantiation
- Prototype chain issues
- Method definition problems
- Script loading order
- Object mutation after creation
