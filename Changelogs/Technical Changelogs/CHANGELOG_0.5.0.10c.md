# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c - Battle Log UI & Pause Fix

## Overview
This update addresses two critical issues from the previous version:
1. Fixed the pauseBattle/resumeBattle functionality
2. Added a comprehensive Battle Log UI for better player feedback

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Pause Button Functionality

#### Problem
The pause button was failing with `TypeError: this.battleManager.pauseBattle is not a function` because the method wasn't implemented.

#### Solution
- Added dedicated `pauseBattle()` and `resumeBattle()` methods to BattleManager
- Updated BattleControlPanel to properly handle pause/resume with better fallbacks
- Improved error handling for pause/resume operations

#### Code Changes
- Added two new methods to BattleManager:
  - `pauseBattle()`: Safely pauses the battle and clears timers
  - `resumeBattle()`: Safely resumes the battle from a paused state
- Updated BattleControlPanel to use these methods through BattleBridge
- Added fallback to directly use window.battleManager if BattleBridge is unavailable

### 2. Battle Log UI Implementation

#### Problem
Battle events were being logged to the console but not displayed to the user in-game.

#### Solution
- Created a new `BattleLogPanel` component for displaying battle events
- Enhanced BattleManager's logging system to dispatch events through BattleBridge
- Added a dedicated `BATTLE_LOG` event type to BattleBridge
- Integrated the log panel into the BattleScene

#### Code Changes
- **New Component**: Created `BattleLogPanel.js` with:
  - Scrollable log with message history
  - Color-coded message types
  - Auto-scrolling functionality
  - Clear log button
  - Connection to BattleBridge events
- **BattleManager Updates**:
  - Enhanced `logMessage()` method to dispatch events through BattleBridge
  - Added validation for message types
  - Improved error handling
- **BattleBridge Updates**:
  - Added `BATTLE_LOG` event type
  - Improved handling of log message dispatching
- **BattleScene Updates**:
  - Added log panel creation and initialization
  - Properly cleaned up log panel on scene shutdown

### 3. First-Entry Crash Fix

The implementation addresses the first-entry crash issue through:
- Improved handling of status effect loading in BattleManager
- Better error recovery with fallback mechanisms in BattleControlPanel
- More robust initialization sequence in BattleScene

## Technical Notes

### Battle Log Features
- Displays color-coded messages for different event types:
  - Default: White
  - Info: Light blue
  - Success: Light green 
  - Action: Orange/yellow
  - Error: Light red
  - Player: Light blue
  - Enemy: Light red
- Auto-scrolling with manual scroll controls
- Message history with timestamp
- Clear log button

### Error Handling Improvements
- Improved error capture and recovery
- Better logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when components are missing

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the Battle Log UI during battle
   - Verify color coding works correctly
   - Test scrolling functionality
   - Confirm log messages match battle events
2. Test the Pause button functionality
   - Verify pause stops all battle actions
   - Verify resume continues the battle correctly
   - Test with different battle speeds
3. Test first-entry crash fix
   - Start a new battle after page load
   - Verify the battle loads correctly on first try

## Known Limitations
- Auto-scrolling may not keep up with very fast battle speeds
- Some minor UI positioning may need adjustment based on screen size
- Log messages are limited to ~30 entries to prevent performance issues
