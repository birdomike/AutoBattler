# CHANGELOG 0.5.13 - BattleFlowController Final Cleanup

## Changes Overview
This update completes the Stage 3 refactoring by removing all the temporary scaffolding that was needed during the BattleFlowController migration. The core battle flow (turn management, action execution, etc.) is now fully handled by the BattleFlowController component, making BattleManager a thin facade that simply delegates to the appropriate specialized component.

## Technical Details

### 1. BattleManager.js Changes
- **Removed Feature Toggle**: Removed the `useNewFlowController` property that was used during the transition.
- **Removed Toggle Method**: Deleted the `toggleFlowController()` method that was used for testing.
- **Updated Initialization**: Modified `initializeComponentManagers()` to treat BattleFlowController as a required dependency.
- **Simplified Battle Flow Methods**: Converted all conditional wrappers to direct delegates:
  - `startBattle()` - Now directly calls `this.battleFlowController.startBattle()`
  - `startNextTurn()` - Now directly calls `this.battleFlowController.startNextTurn()`
  - `executeNextAction()` - Now directly calls `this.battleFlowController.executeNextAction()`
  - `finishTurn()` - Now directly calls `this.battleFlowController.finishTurn()`
  - `checkBattleEnd()` - Now directly returns result from `this.battleFlowController.checkBattleEnd()`
  - `endBattle()` - Now directly calls `this.battleFlowController.endBattle()`
- **Removed Legacy Code Blocks**: Deleted all legacy implementations that were kept as fallbacks.
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for missing BattleFlowController dependency.

### 2. BattleBridge.js Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Updated comments to clearly document which methods are now handled by BattleFlowController.
- **Consolidated Comments**: Combined scattered comments about removed patches into a single comprehensive block.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Updated logging to indicate which methods are now delegated.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependency Management
The BattleFlowController is now a hard dependency - the system will throw an error if it's missing. This ensures proper architecture enforcement while simplifying the code. The error message is specific and helpful:
```javascript
// If BattleFlowController is missing
console.error('BattleManager: BattleFlowController not found on global window object');
throw new Error('BattleFlowController is required but not available');
```

### Code Size Impact
- **Before**: 2,800+ lines in BattleManager.js
- **After**: ~1,500 lines in BattleManager.js (46% reduction)

### Improved Architecture
This update completes the architectural transition to a more modular system:
- **BattleManager**: Thin interface layer that coordinates between components
- **BattleFlowController**: Handles battle sequence and flow
- **StatusEffectManager**: Manages status effects (implementation completed in Stage 2)

This modular architecture makes the system more maintainable by:
1. Reducing code complexity through single responsibility
2. Improving debuggability by isolating functionality
3. Enabling future enhancements to be made in smaller, targeted components
4. Providing clearer dependencies between components

## Testing Steps
To validate this change, check:
1. Start a battle with the new direct delegation using the BattleFlowController
2. Verify battle turn flow works correctly
3. Confirm action indicators appear during battles
4. Validate status effects apply and process correctly
5. Check that battle outcome (victory/defeat) screens appear properly
6. Verify battle log messages appear during battle

## Known Issues
None expected - this is primarily a code cleanup release removing temporary scaffolding.

## Future Work
With the battle flow successfully migrated, focus can now shift to Stage 4 of the refactoring plan:
- Damage and healing system refactoring
- Ability processing improvements
- Passive system enhancements
