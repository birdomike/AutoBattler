# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.1 - Card Frame Turn Indicator Implementation

## Overview
This update replaces the previous TurnIndicator system (which used a flattened ellipse below characters) with a new integrated approach that highlights the CardFrame of the active character. The change improves visual consistency with the new card-based battle UI and creates a cleaner, more cohesive display of the active character.

## Problem Analysis
The previous turn indicator system had several issues:

1. **Visual Inconsistency**: The flattened ellipse indicators didn't match the visual style of the card-based UI.
2. **Positioning Challenges**: The floor markers sometimes appeared at incorrect positions relative to the cards.
3. **Indirect Visual Association**: The disconnect between the indicator and the card itself made it less intuitive to identify the active character.
4. **Redundant Systems**: Maintaining separate highlighting mechanisms for selection and turn indication created unnecessary complexity.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Extended CardFrameInteractionComponent
The solution leverages the existing CardFrameInteractionComponent, which was originally designed for hover and selection effects. We extended it with:

- **New Configuration Options**:
  ```javascript
  activeTurn: {
      glowColorPlayer: 0x4488FF,     // Blue glow for player team
      glowColorEnemy: 0xFF4444,      // Red glow for enemy team
      glowIntensity: 1.0,            // Intensity of the glow effect (0-1)
      pulseScale: 1.05,              // Scale factor during pulse animation
      pulseDuration: 700,            // Duration of one pulse cycle in ms
      priority: true                 // Whether turn highlighting takes visual priority
  }
  ```

- **Independent State Tracking**: 
  Added a new internal state variable `_activeTurn` to track turn highlighting state separately from selection/hover states.

- **Public Methods**: 
  - `showActiveTurnHighlight(teamType)`: Applies team-colored glow and pulsing animation
  - `hideActiveTurnHighlight()`: Removes the turn highlight effect, restoring previous selection/highlight state if active

- **Helper Method**:
  - `applyActiveTurnGlow(glowColor)`: Creates custom glow effect for the active turn

### 2. Visual Effects
The turn indicator now consists of:

1. **Team-specific Glow**: Blue for player team characters, red for enemy team characters
2. **Subtle Pulsing Animation**: The card gently pulses to draw attention (1.05x scaling)
3. **Enhanced Glow Layers**: The glow uses an additional layer for a more distinct look

### 3. State Management
The implementation carefully manages state transitions:

- When a character becomes active, its card's `_activeTurn` state is set to true
- When a character's turn ends, the highlight is removed and any previous state (selection/highlighting) is restored
- Clean-up methods properly dispose of animation tweens and visual effects

## Benefits

1. **Visual Coherence**: The turn indicator is now an integrated part of the card representation
2. **Clearer Identification**: More obvious which character is active during complex battles
3. **Simpler Architecture**: Leverages existing card frame interaction component instead of maintaining a separate system
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Visual effects are now centralized in CardFrameInteractionComponent
5. **Dynamic Styling**: Team-specific colors provide intuitive identification of which team is acting

## Future Work

1. **Transition Animations**: Consider adding smoother transitions between turn changes
2. **Enhanced Visual Distinction**: Potential refinements to make the active turn highlight more distinct from selection highlighting
3. **Sound Effects**: Integrate with the audio system to provide audio cues for turn changes
4. **Finalize Deprecation**: Complete the removal of `TurnIndicator.js` after testing confirms the new system works correctly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component-Based Design**: This implementation reinforces the value of our component-based architecture, making it easy to extend existing components for new functionality.
2. **State Independence**: Maintaining separate state variables for different visual states (selected, highlighted, active turn) helps avoid complex state interactions.
3. **Visual Priority**: Setting clear rules for which visual effects take precedence when multiple states are active improves consistency.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: The implementation ensures that removing the turn highlight restores any previous visual state, maintaining a predictable user experience.
