# CHANGELOG 0.5.18 - Battle Flow Diagnostics

## Issue Description
After implementing the BattleFlowController refactoring and fixing the TypeErrors in v0.5.17, a new issue emerged where battles would start, process the first character's action (Zephyr's Wind Slash) and log the damage, but then completely stall with no further actions occurring.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appeared to be in the `executeNextAction()` method in BattleFlowController.js. Execution was stopping after `await this.applyActionEffect(action)` completed, but before the `setTimeout` call that schedules the next action.

A key factor was that `checkBattleEnd()` was being called without `await`, despite being an asynchronous method. This meant the function could return before the asynchronous check completed, potentially causing the flow to terminate prematurely.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Diagnostic Logging
Added strategic console.log statements at key points in the execution flow to trace exactly where processing stopped:

```javascript
// DIAGNOSTIC: Trace executeNextAction flow - Remove later
console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Effect applied for ${action?.actor?.name}.`);

console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Checking battle end...`);
if (await this.checkBattleEnd()) {
    console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Battle ended, returning.`);
    return; // Battle ended, don't continue
}
console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Battle not ended.`);

console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Scheduling next action...`);
```

### 2. Fixed Async Handling
Added `await` to the `checkBattleEnd()` call to ensure proper async handling:

```javascript
// Before:
if (this.checkBattleEnd()) {
    return; // Battle ended, don't continue
}

// After:
if (await this.checkBattleEnd()) {
    console.log(`>>> BFC.executeNextAction: Battle ended, returning.`);
    return; // Battle ended, don't continue
}
```

This ensures the function waits for the battle end check to complete before continuing the execution flow.

### 3. Added Clear Comment for Future Removal
Added a prominently marked comment to indicate these diagnostic logs should be removed later:
```javascript
// DIAGNOSTIC: Trace executeNextAction flow - Remove later
```

## Results & Benefits
- The diagnostic logs provide a clear trace of execution flow in the battle sequence
- The proper async handling ensures battle flow continues correctly
- The battle flow debugging became significantly easier with the added trace points
- The logs helped quickly identify the subsequent issue with the missing cooldown reduction method

## Next Steps
Once the battle flow issues are fully resolved, the diagnostic logs should be removed as they are intended for debugging only. The key async/await fix should remain to ensure proper asynchronous execution flow.
