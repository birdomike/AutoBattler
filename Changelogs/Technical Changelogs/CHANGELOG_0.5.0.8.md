## Enemy Team Generation Timing Fix

This update resolves the timing issue where the enemy team would not be fully generated before the battle scene was initialized, resulting in placeholder enemies being shown.

### Problem Analysis

The enemy team generation was happening asynchronously (with await/async fetch calls), but the code wasn't waiting for it to complete before starting the battle scene:

```javascript
// The problem in sequence:
this.teamManager.generateEnemyTeam(battleMode); // Async operation starts
// Code continues immediately without waiting
const battleData = {
    playerTeam: this.teamManager.playerTeam,
    enemyTeam: this.teamManager.enemyTeam, // Still empty at this point
    // ...
};
window.game.scene.start('BattleScene', battleData); // Battle scene gets empty enemy team
```

This resulted in the battle scene receiving an empty enemy team, causing it to fall back to placeholder enemies. Later, the enemy team would be generated successfully but too late to be used by the battle scene.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Modified TeamManager.js

Updated the `generateEnemyTeam` method to return a Promise that resolves when the team generation is complete:

```javascript
/**
 * Generate an enemy team based on battle mode
 * @param {string} mode - Battle mode ('random', 'custom', 'campaign')
 * @returns {Promise} - Promise that resolves when enemy team generation is complete
 */
async generateEnemyTeam(mode) {
    this.enemyTeam = [];

    let generationPromise;

    switch (mode) {
        case 'random':
            generationPromise = this.generateRandomTeam();
            break;
        // ... other modes ...
    }

    // Wait for team generation to complete
    await generationPromise;
    
    console.log('Enemy team generation complete:', this.enemyTeam);
    return this.enemyTeam;
}
```

This change ensures that the method doesn't resolve until the enemy team is fully populated.

#### 2. Updated TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js

Modified the `startBattleWithPhaser` method to wait for enemy team generation:

```javascript
// Start a battle with Phaser instead of DOM-based battle UI
TeamBuilderUI.prototype.startBattleWithPhaser = async function(team, battleMode) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Generate enemy team with proper async handling
    let teamGenerationPromise;
    if (battleMode === 'custom' && this.isSelectingEnemyTeam) {
        // ... custom team logic ...
    } else {
        // For other modes, generate enemy team as usual
        teamGenerationPromise = this.teamManager.generateEnemyTeam(battleMode);
    }
    
    // Wait for team generation to complete before proceeding
    console.log('Waiting for enemy team generation to complete...');
    try {
        await teamGenerationPromise;
        console.log('Enemy team generation complete, proceeding with battle');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error during enemy team generation:', error);
        alert('Error generating enemy team. Please try again.');
        return;
    }
    
    // ... continue with battle scene initialization ...
}
```

Also updated the `startBattle` method to be async and properly await the battle start:

```javascript
TeamBuilderUI.prototype.startBattle = async function() {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (usePhaser) {
        // Call the Phaser-specific method and await it
        await this.startBattleWithPhaser(team, this.battleMode);
    } else {
        // ... original battle UI fallback ...
    }
}
```

### Expected Results

This change ensures that:

1. The enemy team is fully generated before the battle scene receives the battle data
2. No placeholder enemies are needed as the real enemy team is ready
3. The battle can start with the properly composed teams on both sides

The change relies on JavaScript's async/await pattern to maintain a clean code structure while properly handling the asynchronous nature of the team generation process.

### Testing Recommendations

To verify this fix works properly:
1. Start a battle in random mode and check that enemy characters appear (not placeholders)
2. Check console logs for "Enemy team generation complete, proceeding with battle" followed by the battle scene initialization
3. Verify that the correct number of enemy characters appears (should be 3 to match player team)
4. Confirm that the battle plays out normally with both player and enemy teams
