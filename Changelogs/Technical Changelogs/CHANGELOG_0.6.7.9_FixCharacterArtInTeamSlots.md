# Changelog: Fix Character Art in Team Slots with View Toggle

## Version 0.6.7.9 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update fixes an issue introduced in version 0.6.7.8 where character art was no longer appearing in the 'Your Team' slots after implementing the view toggle feature. The problem occurred because the TeamSlotsManager component was not passing the new `viewMode` parameter to the TeamBuilderImageLoader's `drawArt` method, causing art to be inconsistently displayed in different parts of the UI.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue stemmed from an incomplete update during the implementation of the view toggle feature. While the `HeroGridManager` was correctly passing the `viewMode` parameter to the `drawArt` method, this parameter was not being propagated through two other important paths:

1. **TeamSlotsManager**: When drawing a hero in a team slot, it was not aware of the current view mode and did not pass it to `drawArt`.

2. **TeamBuilderImageLoader's Helper Methods**: Several helper methods in TeamBuilderImageLoader (`createAndAddArt`, `loadCharacterArt`, etc.) were not updated to accept and forward the `viewMode` parameter.

The `drawArt` method had a default value of 'full' for the `viewMode` parameter, but the inconsistent passing of this parameter was causing visual discrepancies between different parts of the UI.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Updated TeamSlotsManager to Get and Pass View Mode
Added a new method `getViewMode()` to retrieve the current view mode from HeroGridManager:

```javascript
/**
 * Get the current view mode from HeroGridManager if available
 * @returns {string} The current view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
getViewMode() {
  // Try to get the viewMode from HeroGridManager
  if (this.parentUI && this.parentUI.heroGridManager && this.parentUI.heroGridManager.viewMode) {
    return this.parentUI.heroGridManager.viewMode;
  }
  
  // Fallback to 'full' if not available
  return 'full';
}
```

Modified the character art drawing code to pass this view mode to `drawArt`:

```javascript
// Explicitly draw the character art
if (this.imageLoader && typeof this.imageLoader.drawArt === 'function') {
  // Get the current view mode from HeroGridManager
  const viewMode = this.getViewMode();
  console.log(`[TeamSlotsManager] Drawing team slot art for ${currentTeam[i].name} with viewMode: ${viewMode}`);
  this.imageLoader.drawArt(currentTeam[i], heroIconContainer, false, viewMode);
}
```

#### 2. Updated TeamBuilderImageLoader Helper Methods
Modified `createAndAddArt` to accept and pass the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Create and add character art to a container (Legacy method, now a wrapper for drawArt)
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The container element
 * @param {string} characterId - Character ID
 * @param {string} characterName - Character name
 * @param {boolean} isFirstLoad - Whether this is the first time loading this character
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode to use ('full' or 'compact')
 * @returns {boolean} Whether the art was successfully added
 */
async createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, isFirstLoad, viewMode = 'full') {
    // Find character data
    const character = this.findCharacterData(characterId, characterName);
    if (!character) {
        console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: Character data not found for ${characterName}`);
        return false;
    }
    
    // Determine if this is a detail view
    const isDetailView = container.classList.contains('detail-icon-container');
    
    // Use the new drawArt method with viewMode parameter
    return this.drawArt(character, container, isDetailView, viewMode);
}
```

Updated `loadCharacterArt` to handle the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Load art for a specific character
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - The DOM container element
 * @param {string} characterId - The character ID
 * @param {string} characterName - The character name
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 * @returns {boolean} Whether new art was loaded
 */
loadCharacterArt(container, characterId, characterName, viewMode = 'full') {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // If no inner content in wrapper, we need to add the image
    if (artWrapper.innerHTML.trim() === '') {
        this.createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, false, viewMode);
        return true; // Consider as new art being added
    }
    
    // ...existing code...
    
    // If we get here, character needs art and hasn't been loaded yet
    return this.createAndAddArt(container, characterId, characterName, true, viewMode);
}
```

#### 3. Updated Periodic Checking Methods
Modified `checkAndLoadImages` and `startImageCheck` to accept and propagate the `viewMode` parameter:

```javascript
/**
 * Check for character elements and load images if needed
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
checkAndLoadImages(viewMode = 'full') {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Process and load art for this character if needed
    if (this.loadCharacterArt(container, characterId, characterName, viewMode)) {
        artLoadedInThisPass = true;
    }
    
    // ...existing code...
}

/**
 * Start periodically checking for character elements that need art
 * @param {string} viewMode - The view mode ('full' or 'compact')
 */
startImageCheck(viewMode = 'full') {
    // Clear any existing timer
    if (this.imageCheckTimer) {
        clearInterval(this.imageCheckTimer);
    }
    
    // Set up periodic check - just basic checking, no forced updates
    this.imageCheckTimer = setInterval(() => {
        this.checkAndLoadImages(viewMode);
    }, this.checkInterval);
    
    // Run an immediate check
    this.checkAndLoadImages(viewMode);
}
```

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Cascading Parameter Updates
The main challenge was identifying all code paths that needed to be updated to propagate the `viewMode` parameter. Since there were several helper methods that indirectly call `drawArt`, all of these needed to be updated to accept and forward the parameter.

#### 2. Maintaining Backward Compatibility
While updating the methods, we needed to ensure backward compatibility by setting default values for the `viewMode` parameter in all methods. This ensures the code continues to work even if some components haven't been updated to pass the parameter.

#### 3. Cross-Component Communication
The implementation requires TeamSlotsManager to access the current view mode from HeroGridManager. This highlights the importance of proper cross-component communication patterns, which we addressed by adding a `getViewMode()` method that safely retrieves the value with appropriate fallbacks.

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistent Visual Appearance**: Character art now appears consistently across all parts of the UI, regardless of the selected view mode.

2. **Proper Layout in Team Slots**: Team slots now display character art with the correct scaling and positioning based on the current view mode.

3. **Seamless View Toggling**: The view toggle now affects the entire UI, including team slots, for a cohesive experience.

### Testing Considerations

The implementation has been tested for:

1. **View Mode Consistency**: Ensuring character art appears correctly in both view modes.

2. **Team Slot Integration**: Verifying that adding heroes to team slots displays their art correctly.

3. **Dynamic View Switching**: Testing that switching between view modes updates all parts of the UI correctly.

4. **Compatibility with Existing Features**: Ensuring these changes don't interfere with other functionality such as detailed hero view or team synergies.

This fix ensures that the view toggle feature introduced in 0.6.7.8 works correctly and cohesively across all parts of the TeamBuilder UI.
