# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.26 - ActionIndicator Context-Aware Text Fix

## Issue Description

Area of Effect (AoE) abilities like "Tidal Wave" or "Frost Chain" were displaying "Auto Attack" in the ActionIndicator text instead of the actual ability name due to a hardcoded text override. A temporary fix was implemented in v0.6.3.25 by commenting out the problematic line, but a more robust, context-aware solution was needed.

## Root Cause Recap

The root cause identified in v0.6.3.25 was a hardcoded line in `CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation()` that explicitly set the action text to "Auto Attack" regardless of the actual action being performed:

```javascript
// This line was causing AoE abilities to display 'Auto Attack' instead of their actual name
this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
```

This line unconditionally overwrote the action text that had been properly set by the CHARACTER_ACTION event in BattleEventManager.onCharacterAction, causing all actions to display as "Auto Attack" during animations.

## Technical Solution

A comprehensive solution was implemented with the following improvements:

1. **Action Context Parameter**: Added an `actionContext` parameter to `CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation()` to provide explicit information about the action being animated:
   ```javascript
   showAttackAnimation(targetSprite, onComplete, actionContext)
   ```

2. **Conditional Text Display**: Implemented context-aware logic to only set the action text when appropriate:
   ```javascript
   if (actionContext) {
       if (actionContext.actionType === 'autoAttack') {
           this.showActionText('Auto Attack');
       } else if (actionContext.actionType === 'ability') {
           // For abilities, BattleEventManager should have already set the text
           // via the CHARACTER_ACTION event, so we don't override it here
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Parameter Propagation**: Modified the call chain to pass the appropriate action context:
   - `BattleEventManager.onCharacterDamaged` → Creates actionContext based on ability data
   - `BattleScene.showAttackAnimation` → Passes actionContext to CharacterSprite
   - `CharacterSprite.showAttackAnimation` → Uses actionContext to make decisions

4. **Fallback Inference**: Added fallback logic in BattleScene to infer the action type when context isn't provided:
   ```javascript
   if (!actionContext) {
       // Try to infer the action type
       const inferredActionType = attacker.lastUsedAbility ? 'ability' : 'autoAttack';
       const inferredAbilityName = attacker.lastUsedAbility?.name || 'Unknown Ability';
       
       actionContext = {
           actionType: inferredActionType,
           abilityName: inferredAbilityName
       };
   }
   ```

## Implementation Details

### 1. CharacterSprite.js Changes

- Modified signature of `showAttackAnimation` to accept actionContext parameter
- Replaced commented-out line with intelligent context-aware logic
- Added detailed logging for action text decisions
- Implemented warnings for missing context

### 2. BattleScene.js Changes

- Updated `showAttackAnimation` method to accept and propagate the actionContext
- Implemented fallback context generation when not provided
- Added logging for context inference

### 3. BattleEventManager.js Changes

- Enhanced `onCharacterDamaged` to create and pass actionContext
- Added different contexts for abilities vs. auto-attacks
- Improved logging for debugging

## Rationale for this Approach

This solution offers several advantages over the previous fix:

1. **Intentionality**: Makes decisions explicitly based on action type rather than silently omitting code
2. **Correctness**: Ensures "Auto Attack" appears for actual auto-attacks, while preserving ability names
3. **Defensive Programming**: Includes multiple fallback mechanisms and detailed logging
4. **Future Compatibility**: Creates a extensible framework for handling different action types
5. **Architecture Alignment**: Respects the event-driven design where CHARACTER_ACTION events set initial text

## Testing Points

The changes should be tested with:

1. **Auto-Attacks**: Verify "Auto Attack" appears correctly
2. **Single-Target Abilities**: Verify the ability name appears correctly
3. **AoE Abilities**: Verify the ability name appears correctly for all targets
4. **Mixed Scenarios**: Verify correct behavior in sequences of different action types
5. **Edge Cases**: Test behavior when context is missing or incomplete

## Future Improvements

While this implementation resolves the current issue, further enhancements could include:

1. Standardizing the actionContext structure across the entire battle system
2. Adding more action types beyond 'ability' and 'autoAttack' (e.g., 'passive', 'counterattack')
3. Creating a unified ActionContext class with validation and helper methods
4. Adding visual differentiation between different action types

## Lessons Learned

1. **Parameter Enrichment**: Adding context parameters to methods enables more intelligent decisions
2. **Event-Driven Coordination**: The character of an action should be driven by events, not hardcoded
3. **Defensive Fallbacks**: Multiple layers of fallback logic provide resilience
4. **Explicit over Implicit**: Making decisions based on explicit context improves maintainability

This fix addresses a specific issue while laying groundwork for more robust action indication in future development.
