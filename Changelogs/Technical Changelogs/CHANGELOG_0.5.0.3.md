# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.3 - Core Phaser Initialization Fix

## Overview
This update focuses on fixing critical issues with Phaser initialization and scene transitions that were preventing the battle scene from displaying properly. The primary goal was to ensure users can successfully start a battle and see it rendered in Phaser, with clear visual confirmation that the battle scene is working correctly.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Fixed Phaser Game Initialization
- Created new `PhaserConfig.js` utility for robust Phaser initialization
- Fixed the error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'initContainer')` in game.js
- Added defensive error handling to prevent cascading failures
- Ensured proper global references (`window.game`) for cross-file access
- Added utility function `window.isPhaserReady()` to check Phaser availability

### 2. Fixed Scene Transition Issues
- Fixed transition from TeamBuilder to Battle Scene in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js
- Added robust error handling to prevent infinite loops during failed transitions
- Implemented proper fallback mechanism when Phaser initialization fails
- Improved DOM element visibility toggling during transitions
- Added detailed logging for debugging transition issues

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Added a colorful animated test pattern to confirm the scene is rendering
- Created welcome message showing player and enemy team information
- Improved scene title with animation
- Added enhanced background with grid patterns
- Implemented proper visual feedback for battle events

### 4. Fixed Return Navigation
- Improved return button functionality
- Added proper cleanup before exiting to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed transition back to TeamBuilder UI
- Added multiple fallbacks for emergency recovery

## Implementation Details

### PhaserConfig.js Implementation
- Created a utility module for standardized Phaser initialization
- Added container creation and configuration
- Implemented game configuration generation with proper defaults
- Added detection methods for Phaser availability

### TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js Improvements
- Restructured startBattleWithPhaser method with proper error handling
- Added fallback prevention to avoid infinite loops
- Improved DOM element management during transitions
- Fixed method references for TeamBuilderUI integration

### BattleScene.js Enhancements
- Added animated test pattern with colorful circles and tweens
- Created welcome message showing battle configuration
- Improved event handling for battle events (turn start, damage, etc.)
- Enhanced visual feedback for all battle actions
- Added improved background and scene title

## Technical Notes
- This update prioritizes fixing core functionality over implementing advanced features
- The focus was on providing immediate visual feedback to confirm proper initialization
- All critical methods now include defensive programming with try/catch blocks
- Global references are properly maintained and checked before use
- Proper fallbacks are implemented for all critical operations

## Next Steps
- Version 0.5.0.4: Implement basic character visualization
- Version 0.5.0.5: Integrate basic battle flow with BattleManager
- Version 0.5.0.6: Add simple battle animations

## Testing Notes
When testing this version, you should see:
1. Successful transition to the Phaser canvas when starting a battle
2. Animated colorful circles in the center of the screen
3. Welcome message showing your team information
4. Ability to return to the Team Builder UI
5. Visual effects for battle events if BattleManager is available
