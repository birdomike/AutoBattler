# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.2.5 - 2025-05-14

## Reduced Floor Indicator Size for Better UI Spacing

This update reduces the size of the turn indicators to better fit between the health bar and character feet.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Reduced highlight ellipse dimensions by 50%:**

```javascript
// Before
this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset - 2, 110, 25, teamColor, 0.4);

// After
this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset - 2, 55, 13, teamColor, 0.4);
```

**Reduced shadow ellipse dimensions by 50%:**

```javascript
// Before
this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset, 120, 30, 0x000000, 0.4);

// After
this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset, 60, 15, 0x000000, 0.4);
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Size Reduction**:
   - Reduced both highlight and shadow dimensions by approximately 50%
   - Maintained the same aspect ratio to preserve the flattened appearance
   - Kept the same vertical positioning for alignment with character feet
   - Maintained the same opacity level for visual consistency

2. **Improved UI Spacing**:
   - Created more space between the indicator and health bar display
   - Reduced visual crowding in the character display area
   - Enhanced the overall aesthetic by using a more appropriately sized indicator
   - Better proportion between character sprites and their turn indicators

### Visual Effect

The smaller floor indicators provide these benefits:
- Better fit between the health bar and character feet
- Less visual dominance in the battle scene
- More proportional relationship to character size
- Maintained team color clarity while taking up less screen space

This adjustment improves the overall UI balance of the battle scene by ensuring that the turn indicators are appropriately sized relative to the characters and other UI elements.
