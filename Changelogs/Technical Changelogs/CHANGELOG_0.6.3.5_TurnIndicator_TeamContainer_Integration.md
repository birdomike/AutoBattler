# Changelog: TurnIndicator TeamContainer Integration (v0.6.3.5)

## Overview

This update integrates the TurnIndicator directly into TeamContainer to improve the turn highlighting system. The changes centralize all turn indicator logic within the dedicated TurnIndicator component while removing the need for CharacterSprite's highlight/unhighlight methods.

## Technical Changes

### TeamContainer.js

1. **Modified constructor**:
   - Added initialization of a dedicated TurnIndicator instance per team
   - Implemented proper error handling with descriptive log messages
   - Added null initialization for better fault tolerance

2. **Rewrote showTurnIndicator method**:
   - Removed calls to CharacterSprite.highlight()
   - Removed the loop that unhighlights all other characters
   - Added direct TurnIndicator positioning logic
   - Implemented team-specific colors (blue for player team, red for enemy team)
   - Added proper position calculation with vertical offset for indicator placement
   - Enhanced logging and error handling

3. **Updated clearTurnIndicators method**:
   - Replaced CharacterSprite.unhighlight() loops with direct TurnIndicator.hide() call
   - Added proper error handling for missing TurnIndicator instances
   - Commented out original code for reference while transitioning
   - Improved diagnostic logging

4. **Enhanced destroy method**:
   - Added proper cleanup of TurnIndicator resources
   - Implemented validation before destroy calls
   - Added cleanup logging for debugging

## Implementation Approach

This implementation follows a component-based architecture pattern, moving the visual responsibility from character sprites to a dedicated visual component. Key aspects of the approach:

1. **Clear separation of concerns**:
   - TeamContainer manages team-level organization and character relationships
   - TurnIndicator handles exclusively the visual representation of the turn indicator
   - CharacterSprite no longer needs to implement visual highlighting

2. **Defensive programming**:
   - Comprehensive null checking for all component references
   - Try-catch blocks around initialization code
   - Fallback behavior when components are missing
   - Detailed logging for debugging

3. **Improved visual consistency**:
   - Team-specific colors (blue/red) for clearer team identification
   - Consistent positioning relative to character's feet
   - Smooth animations controlled by a single component

## Benefits

- **Code organization**: Turn highlighting functionality is now centralized in TurnIndicator component
- **Visual consistency**: All turn indicators share the same visual implementation
- **Reduced duplication**: Removed highlighting code from CharacterSprite
- **Simplified maintenance**: Visual tweaks can be made in a single file
- **Improved architecture**: Follows component-based design principles

## Future Considerations

- Complete removal of highlight/unhighlight methods from CharacterSprite after transition period
- Further optimization of indicator positioning based on character sprite dimensions
- Potential enhancements to the TurnIndicator visual effects
