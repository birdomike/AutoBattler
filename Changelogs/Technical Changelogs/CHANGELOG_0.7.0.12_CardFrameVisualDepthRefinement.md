## CHANGELOG 0.7.0.12 - Refined Card Frame Visual Depth

## Overview
This update refines the visual depth implementation for card frames, focusing on applying the glow effect to the frame itself rather than the backdrop. This creates a more cohesive visual presentation and emphasizes the card's type identity more clearly. The original implementation had the glow effect applied to the inner backdrop area, but this revision creates a more polished look by having the glow originate from the frame border.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Layering Refinement
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Modified the construction order of card components

```javascript
// Create card components in proper layer order
this.createBackdrop();

// Add inner glow effect if enabled
if (this.config.depthEffects.enabled && this.config.depthEffects.innerGlow.enabled) {
    this.createInnerGlowEffect();
}

// Create base frame
this.createBaseFrame();

// Add edge depth effects if enabled
if (this.config.depthEffects.enabled && this.config.depthEffects.edgeEffects.enabled) {
    this.addEdgeDepthEffects();
}

this.createPortraitWindow();
```

This change ensures proper visual layering with components rendered in this order:
1. Backdrop (bottom layer)
2. Inner glow effect (middle layer)
3. Frame border (top layer)
4. Edge highlights/shadows (on top of frame)

### 2. Separated Backdrop Creation
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Renamed `createBackgroundElements()` to `createBackdrop()` and simplified its functionality

The new `createBackdrop()` method has a single responsibility: creating the card's background rectangle. This separation allows for cleaner layering of visual components and better adheres to the single responsibility principle.

Key changes:
- Removed inner shadow effect (now handled in the glow layer)
- Simplified to only create and store the backdrop rectangle
- Improved naming for better code readability

### 3. Enhanced Inner Glow Implementation
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Completely revised the `createInnerGlowEffect()` method

The new implementation:
- Draws the glow effect at the frame border rather than inside the backdrop
- Creates a more visible and type-emphasizing effect
- Scales the glow based on the border width for a more natural appearance
- Adds the graphics object directly to the container instead of returning it
- Stores a reference to the graphics object for proper cleanup

Key code changes:
```javascript
// Draw glow layer - applied to frame border, not backdrop
glowGraphics.fillStyle(this.typeColor, layerOpacity);
glowGraphics.fillRoundedRect(
    -width / 2 + layerPadding,
    -height / 2 + layerPadding,
    width - (layerPadding * 2),
    height - (layerPadding * 2),
    cornerRadius
);
```

### 4. Improved Resource Management
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Updated `destroy()` method with additional cleanup for new components

Added cleanup code for the new inner glow graphics object and backdrop:
```javascript
if (this.innerGlowGraphics) {
    this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.innerGlowGraphics);
}
if (this.backdrop) {
    this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.backdrop);
}
```

This ensures proper cleanup of all resources when cards are destroyed, preventing memory leaks.

## Visual Impact
- More pronounced type-based glow that emanates from the card border
- Clearer visual hierarchy with the card's type color highlighted at the frame
- More cohesive overall appearance with proper layering of visual elements
- Enhanced 3D-like appearance with the glow serving as a light source at the frame edge

## Technical Benefits
- Better separation of concerns with each method having a single responsibility
- More maintainable code structure with clear component layering
- Improved resource management with proper references and cleanup
- Enhanced visual presentation without performance impact

## Testing Required
- Verify proper layering of visual components
- Ensure glow effect is visible and properly colored for all card types
- Check scaling behavior during hover/selection
- Verify proper cleanup when cards are destroyed
- Test with both light and dark type colors to ensure visibility
