# Changelog 0.5.27.2 - PassiveAbilityManager Implementation

## Overview

This update implements the PassiveAbilityManager component as part of the ongoing BattleManager refactoring (Stage 6: Passive Ability System). This component is responsible for executing passive abilities and determining which passives should trigger for specific events.

## Component Design

### Core Responsibilities
- Process passive abilities for specific trigger events
- Execute passive behaviors through the behavior system
- Manage passive ability execution logic and messaging
- Coordinate with PassiveTriggerTracker for trigger state tracking

### Key Methods
- `processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData)`: Main entry point for processing all passive abilities
- `executePassiveBehavior(character, ability, trigger, additionalData)`: Execute a specific passive behavior
- `canTriggerPassive(character, ability, trigger)`: Check if a passive can trigger
- `logPassiveActivation(character, result)`: Log passive activation messages
- `getPassivesByTriggerType(character, trigger)`: Get passives matching a specific trigger type
- `validateCharacter(character)`: Validate a character has the required properties for passive processing

### Integration with BattleManager
- Added toggle mechanism in BattleManager's `processPassiveAbilities`
- PassiveAbilityManager initializes with references to BattleManager and PassiveTriggerTracker
- Added defensive checks for component dependencies
- Preserved existing behavior while allowing for switch between implementations

## Implementation Details

### Defensive Implementation
The PassiveAbilityManager includes comprehensive defensive programming:

- Parameter validation for all inputs
- Character validation to ensure required properties exist
- Battle behaviors system availability check
- PassiveTriggerTracker availability check
- Error handling for passive execution failures

### Character Validation
Added enhanced character validation to catch common issues:

```javascript
validateCharacter(character) {
    // Basic null check
    if (!character) {
        console.error("[PassiveAbilityManager] Invalid character parameter (null or undefined)");
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check for required properties
    if (!character.name) {
        console.error("[PassiveAbilityManager] Invalid character: missing name property");
        return false;
    }
    
    // Must have stats object for passive calculations
    if (!character.stats) {
        console.error(`[PassiveAbilityManager] Character '${character.name}' missing stats object`);
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check for health properties
    if (typeof character.currentHp !== 'number') {
        console.error(`[PassiveAbilityManager] Character '${character.name}' missing currentHp property`);
        return false;
    }
    
    // More checks...
    
    return true;
}
```

### Max Stacks Implementation
Added support for passive ability stacking limits:

```javascript
// Check max stacks if configured and tracker available
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    const maxStacks = this.passiveTriggerTracker.getMaxStacksForPassive(ability);
    if (maxStacks && this.passiveTriggerTracker.hasReachedMaxStacks(character, ability.id || ability.name, trigger, maxStacks)) {
        console.debug(`[PassiveAbilityManager] ${ability.name} has reached max stacks (${maxStacks})`);
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Passive Context Creation
Created a complete context object for passive execution:

```javascript
const passiveContext = {
    actor: character,
    ability: ability,
    battleManager: this.battleManager,
    teamManager: this.battleManager.teamManager || { getCharacterTeam: (char) => char.team },
    trigger: trigger,
    additionalData: additionalData
};
```

## Integration Process

1. **Initial Implementation**:
   - Created PassiveAbilityManager.js with full functionality
   - Connected it to BattleManager with toggle
   - Added validation logic and defensive programming
   - Preserved all event dispatching from original implementation

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Tested with toggle ON (new implementation)
   - Verified all passive abilities trigger correctly for all trigger types
   - Checked that trigger tracking works correctly (no duplicate triggers)

## Technical Notes

### Export Pattern
Used the global window registration pattern for compatibility:

```javascript
// Make PassiveAbilityManager available globally for traditional scripts
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.PassiveAbilityManager = PassiveAbilityManager;
  console.log("PassiveAbilityManager class definition loaded and exported to window.PassiveAbilityManager");
}

// Legacy global assignment for maximum compatibility
window.PassiveAbilityManager = PassiveAbilityManager;
```

### Backwards Compatibility
The implementation preserves backward compatibility through the toggle mechanism:

```javascript
processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData = {}) {
    // REFACTORING: Use new implementation if toggle is enabled
    if (this.useNewImplementation && this.passiveAbilityManager) {
        return this.passiveAbilityManager.processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData);
    }
    
    // Original implementation follows...
}
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Organization**: Passive ability logic now exists in a dedicated component
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation prevents silent failures
3. **Better Testability**: Component can be tested independently of BattleManager
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to add new passive features or fix issues in a focused component
5. **Performance**: More efficient trigger checking with early exits
6. **Code Clarity**: Clear component boundaries make the codebase more understandable

## Next Steps

1. **Cleanup Phase (v0.5.27.2_Cleanup)**: Remove original implementation code after verification
2. **Performance Profiling**: Evaluate the performance of the new implementation
3. **Feature Enhancements**: Consider additional passive ability features now easier to implement
