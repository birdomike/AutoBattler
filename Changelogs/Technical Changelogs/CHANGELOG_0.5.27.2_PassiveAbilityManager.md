# Technical Changelog: v0.5.27.2 - PassiveAbilityManager Implementation

## Overview

This update implements the `PassiveAbilityManager` component as part of Stage 6 of the BattleManager refactoring plan. This component extracts passive ability execution logic from BattleManager into a dedicated class, improving modularity and reducing the BattleManager's complexity.

## Files Changed

1. **Created**:
   - `js/battle_logic/passives/PassiveAbilityManager.js` - New class for passive ability management

2. **Modified**:
   - `js/managers/BattleManager.js` - Added toggle mechanism and component initialization
   - `index.html` - Added script tag for PassiveAbilityManager

## Implementation Details

### 1. PassiveAbilityManager Component

The `PassiveAbilityManager` encapsulates all passive ability logic in a single, dedicated class with the following responsibilities:

- **Trigger Management**: Determining when passive abilities should trigger
- **Execution**: Processing passive abilities when their trigger conditions are met
- **Integration**: Working with PassiveTriggerTracker to prevent duplicate triggers
- **Validation**: Checking ability validity and behavior availability
- **Event Generation**: Dispatching appropriate events and messages

Key methods:
- `processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData)`: Main entry point for processing passives
- `canTriggerPassive(character, ability, trigger)`: Checks if a passive can be triggered
- `executePassiveBehavior(character, ability, trigger, additionalData)`: Executes the passive behavior
- `logPassiveActivation(character, result)`: Logs passive ability messages
- `getPassivesByTriggerType(character, trigger)`: Utility for filtering passives by trigger type

The implementation includes comprehensive parameter validation, error handling, and defensive coding to ensure robust behavior even when dependencies are missing.

### 2. BattleManager Integration

The `BattleManager` was updated to:

1. **Initialize** the PassiveAbilityManager in its `initializeComponentManagers()` method, passing:
   - Reference to itself (for access to teams, status effects, etc.)
   - Reference to the PassiveTriggerTracker (for trigger tracking)

2. **Add toggle mechanism** to the `processPassiveAbilities()` method:
   ```javascript
   processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData = {}) {
       // REFACTORING: Use new implementation if toggle is enabled
       if (this.useNewImplementation && this.passiveAbilityManager) {
           return this.passiveAbilityManager.processPassiveAbilities(trigger, character, additionalData);
       }
       
       // Original implementation
       // ...original code...
   }
   ```

This approach maintains backward compatibility while allowing for A/B testing between implementations.

### 3. Script Loading

Updated `index.html` to load the new script with proper dependencies:
```html
<!-- Passive System Components -->
<script src="js/battle_logic/passives/PassiveTriggerTracker.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/battle_logic/passives/PassiveAbilityManager.js" defer></script>
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Passive ability logic is now isolated from general battle management
2. **Reduced Complexity**: BattleManager is simpler and more focused on coordinating battle flow
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Passive system can be tested independently
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Dedicated error handling for passive-specific failures
5. **Better Dependencies**: Clear dependency relationships through constructor injection

## Technical Debt Reduction

This implementation reduces technical debt by:

1. Extracting deeply nested conditional logic from BattleManager
2. Centralizing passive ability concerns in a dedicated component
3. Providing defensive validation against invalid inputs
4. Making dependencies explicit through constructor parameters
5. Improving error reporting with component-specific logging

## Testing Approach

The implementation can be tested by:

1. Starting a battle with characters having passive abilities
2. Using the toggle mechanism to compare original vs. new implementations
3. Verifying all passive triggers work correctly:
   - onBattleStart passives
   - onTurnStart passives
   - onDamageTaken/onDamageDealt passives
   - onHealed/onHealingDone passives
4. Checking that battle log messages are consistent between implementations
5. Ensuring trigger tracking works correctly (no duplicate triggers)

## Follow-up: v0.5.27.2_Cleanup

After verification is complete, a follow-up update will:

1. Remove original implementation code from BattleManager
2. Create thin facade methods that delegate to PassiveAbilityManager
3. Add appropriate fallback behavior with warning messages
4. Document code reduction metrics

This component extraction is part of the overall refactoring strategy to transform BattleManager from a monolithic class into a coordinator of specialized component managers.
