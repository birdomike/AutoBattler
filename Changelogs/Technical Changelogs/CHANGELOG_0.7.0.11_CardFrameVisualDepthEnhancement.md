## CHANGELOG 0.7.0.11 - Enhanced Visual Depth for Card Frames

## Overview
This update implements enhanced visual depth effects for the card frame system, transforming the relatively flat card appearance into a more professional, three-dimensional design. The changes focus on two key visual enhancements: inner glow effects and edge highlights/shadows.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configurable Depth Effects System
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Added a new `depthEffects` configuration object structure

```javascript
depthEffects: {
    enabled: true,           // Master toggle for all depth effects
    innerGlow: {
        enabled: true,       // Enable inner glow effect 
        intensity: 0.3,      // Intensity of inner glow (0-1)
        layers: 4            // Number of glow layers (more = smoother but more expensive)
    },
    edgeEffects: {
        enabled: true,       // Enable edge highlights and shadows
        highlightBrightness: 40, // How much brighter the highlights are (%)
        shadowDarkness: 40,  // How much darker the shadows are (%)
        width: 1.5,          // Width of edge effect lines
        opacity: 0.6         // Opacity of edge effects (0-1)
    }
}
```

### 2. Inner Glow Effect Implementation
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Enhanced `createBackgroundElements()` method and added new `createInnerGlowEffect()` method

The inner glow effect creates a soft, glowing aura on the inside edge of the card frame that matches the character's type color. This is implemented using multiple concentric rectangles with decreasing opacity to create a smooth gradient effect. Key implementation details:

- Multi-layered approach with configurable number of layers for smoother appearance
- Each layer decreases in both size and opacity to create the gradient glow effect
- Glow color matches the character's type color for theme consistency
- Proper layering with background, shadow, and glow elements
- Optimized for performance with configurable intensity

### 3. Edge Highlights and Shadows
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Added new `addEdgeDepthEffects()` method

This effect simulates light reflecting off the edges of the card, giving it a 3D appearance with highlights on the top/left edges and shadows on the bottom/right edges. Key implementation details:

- Light source appears to come from top-left (standard in UI design)
- Highlights use brightened versions of the card's type color
- Shadows use darkened versions of the card's type color
- Special handling for corner radiuses to maintain consistent appearance
- Thin, subtle lines to avoid overwhelming the design
- Proper stroke path implementation for smooth appearance

### 4. Proper Resource Management
**File:** `js/phaser/components/ui/CardFrame.js`
**Change:** Enhanced `destroy()` method to clean up all graphics resources

```javascript
// Clean up any tweens for depth effects
if (this.edgeEffects) {
    this.scene.tweens.killTweensOf(this.edgeEffects);
}
```

## Performance Considerations
- Inner glow layers are configurable to balance visual quality vs. performance
- All graphics objects are property cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Edge effects use simple line drawing for optimal performance
- All effects scale properly when the card is scaled (for hover/selection)

## Visual Impact
- Cards now appear to "pop" from the background with a subtle 3D appearance
- Type colors are enhanced through the inner glow, creating better type identity
- The edge highlights create a premium, polished appearance
- Visual hierarchy is improved with the subtle depth cues

## Testing Required
- Verify depth effects display correctly on cards of all types
- Ensure effects scale properly during hover/selection animations
- Check performance with multiple cards on screen
- Verify proper cleanup when cards are destroyed

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding subtle texture overlays based on character type
- Explore adding corner accent pieces that vary by type
- Consider dynamic lighting effects that respond to card state changes
