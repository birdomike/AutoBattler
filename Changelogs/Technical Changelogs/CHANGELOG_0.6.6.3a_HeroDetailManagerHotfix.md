# CHANGELOG 0.6.6.3a - HeroDetailPanelManager Variable Redeclaration Hotfix

## Overview

This hotfix addresses a critical JavaScript error in the HeroDetailPanelManager component that was preventing the hero detail panel from working correctly. The error occurred because of a variable redeclaration issue in the `updateExistingDetails` method.

## Issue Details

When displaying hero details for characters with multiple types (like Aqualia with water/ice), users encountered the following error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'heroTypes' has already been declared (at HeroDetailPanelManager.js:280:13)
```

This error occurred because the `heroTypes` variable was declared twice within the same function scope:
1. First declaration at the beginning of the type relations section
2. Second declaration within the same function when creating the new type relations container

Since JavaScript does not allow redeclaring variables with `const` in the same scope, this was causing the script to fail when trying to display hero details.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Variable Redeclaration

Updated the second declaration of `heroTypes` to use a different variable name:

```javascript
// Before
const heroTypes = TeamBuilderUtils.splitTypes(hero.type);

// After
const typeArray = TeamBuilderUtils.splitTypes(hero.type);
```

### 2. Updated All References

Updated all references to this variable throughout the code to use the new name:

- Updated the forEach loop: `typeArray.forEach(heroType => {...`
- Updated the length check: `if (typeArray.length > 1) {...`
- Updated the index check: `if (typeArray.indexOf(heroType) < typeArray.length - 1) {...`

## Testing

After the fix, the hero details panel works correctly for all heroes, including those with multiple types. The error no longer appears in the console, and all type relations sections display properly.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Unique Variable Names**: When refactoring code that uses the same function in multiple places, be careful about variable names to avoid redeclarations in the same scope.

2. **Quick Detection with Modern Browsers**: The error was fortunately easy to find because modern browsers immediately report syntax errors like variable redeclarations.

3. **Fast Resolution Workflow**: The hotfix process demonstrated a streamlined approach to critical bug fixes:
   - Specific error message led directly to the problematic line
   - Simple renaming fix without needing complex code changes
   - Targeted update to just the affected component

## Future Considerations

This is a reminder to be cautious when duplicating code sections during refactoring. The error occurred because the type relations section was implemented twice - once in the main `renderDetails` method and again in the `updateExistingDetails` method. 

In the future, we should consider extracting such duplicated logic into separate helper methods to avoid similar issues and improve code maintainability.
