# CHANGELOG 0.5.27.1_Hotfix - PassiveTriggerTracker Implementation Fixes

## Overview
This hotfix addresses several critical issues discovered during implementation of the PassiveTriggerTracker component (v0.5.27.1). The fixes restore battle functionality and resolve errors in the passive ability tracking system.

## Technical Changes

### 1. Fixed Missing ActionGenerator Script
- **Issue**: Battle was progressing through turns but no combat actions were occurring
- **Root Cause**: ActionGenerator.js script tag was missing from index.html
- **Fix**: Added the missing script tag with proper load order comments
- **Impact**: Restores combat functionality with characters properly executing actions and abilities

### 2. Fixed Syntax Error in PassiveTriggerTracker
- **Issue**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'typeof'` error in PassiveTriggerTracker.js
- **Root Cause**: Missing closing brace for the class definition
- **Fix**: Added missing `}` to properly close the PassiveTriggerTracker class
- **Impact**: Ensures the PassiveTriggerTracker component loads correctly

### 3. Fixed Module Export in PassiveTriggerTracker
- **Issue**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` error in PassiveTriggerTracker.js
- **Root Cause**: ES module export syntax was incompatible with traditional script loading
- **Fix**: Replaced `export default` with CommonJS-compatible module export wrapped in try/catch
- **Impact**: Prevents JavaScript syntax errors while maintaining export functionality

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling in DirectBattleLog
- **Issue**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` error when processing TURN_STARTED events
- **Root Cause**: TURN_STARTED events sometimes contained null character references
- **Fix**: Added defensive checking for character existence before accessing properties
- **Impact**: Prevents battle log errors when character data is missing and provides fallback messages

## Implementation Details

### ActionGenerator Script
The most serious issue was the missing ActionGenerator script tag, which caused:
- The battle system to use a legacy fallback for action generation
- Characters to skip their turns due to null actions
- No combat to occur despite turn progression

The fix restores the proper battle flow by ensuring the ActionGenerator component is loaded in the correct order, allowing it to:
1. Generate appropriate actions for each character
2. Select abilities based on character state
3. Determine targets through the TargetingSystem
4. Create a proper action queue for the battle manager

### Error Handling Improvements
Additionally, we improved error resilience in:
- DirectBattleLog.js - Added checks for null character data in TURN_STARTED events
- PassiveTriggerTracker.js - Improved module export compatibility
- Key parameter validation throughout the PassiveTriggerTracker component

## Testing Notes
The fixes have been verified to:
- Allow battles to progress with proper combat actions
- Prevent console errors during battle execution
- Maintain proper passive ability tracking
- Ensure correct battle log messages even in edge cases

## Related Components
These fixes impact:
- Battle Flow System (action generation and execution)
- Passive Ability Tracking (StatusEffect application and expiration)
- Battle UI (turn indicators and battle log messages)

## Next Steps
With these hotfixes in place, we can proceed to:
- Complete the PassiveTriggerTracker implementation cleanup (v0.5.27.1_Cleanup)
- Continue with Stage 6 of the BattleManager refactoring plan
- Begin the PassiveAbilityManager implementation (v0.5.27.2)
