# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.4 - Disable and Remove the Old TurnIndicator System

## Overview
This update completely disables and removes the old TurnIndicator system (that used flattened ellipses below characters) to fully transition to the new card frame turn highlighting system implemented in v0.7.5.1-0.7.5.3. This resolves the issue where both the old ellipse indicators and the new card frame pulse effects were appearing simultaneously.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the new card frame turn highlighting in versions 0.7.5.1 through 0.7.5.3, we observed that both indicators were appearing at the same time:

1. **The new pulsing card highlight** was properly working through the delegation chain:  
   CharacterSprite → CardFrame → CardFrameManager → CardFrameInteractionComponent

2. **The old ellipse indicators** were still being created and shown through the original system:  
   TeamDisplayManager → TeamContainer → TurnIndicator

This dual visualization was confusing and visually cluttered. Since we have fully implemented the new card frame turn indicator system, the old system needed to be completely removed.

## Implementation Solution

To fully disable the old TurnIndicator system, we implemented changes across multiple files:

### 1. TeamContainer.js
- Commented out the TurnIndicator instantiation in the constructor
- Modified `showTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Remove all logic related to the old TurnIndicator
  - Only call `sprite.highlight()` to activate the new card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Updated `clearTurnIndicators()` to:
  - Remove all TurnIndicator-related code
  - Directly call `sprite.unhighlight()` to clear card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Commented out TurnIndicator cleanup in the `destroy()` method

### 2. TeamDisplayManager.js
- Modified `createTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Not create any TurnIndicator instances
  - Set `this.turnIndicator = null`
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Updated `updateTurnIndicator()` to:
  - Remove all logic related to the old TurnIndicator
  - Simply call `sprite.highlight()` to activate the new card frame highlighting
  - Add proper deprecation notice
- Commented out TurnIndicator cleanup in the `destroy()` method

### 3. index.html
- Commented out the `<script>` tag that loads TurnIndicator.js:
  ```html
  <!-- TurnIndicator - [DISABLED] Removed in v0.7.5.4 in favor of card frame turn highlighting -->
  <!-- <script src="js/phaser/components/battle/TurnIndicator.js"></script> -->
  ```

## Technical Approach
We took a strategic approach to "soft-deprecate" the TurnIndicator system rather than completely removing its code:

1. **Method Preservation with Deprecation**:
   - Maintained all TurnIndicator-related methods for backward compatibility
   - Added `@deprecated` JSDoc tags to clearly mark deprecated methods
   - Added descriptive comments explaining the deprecation reason
   
2. **Commented Code Instead of Removal**:
   - Used commented blocks to preserve the original implementation
   - Added `[DISABLED]` markers in comments
   - Preserved the logic for documentation purposes while preventing execution

3. **Method Redirection**:
   - Modified methods to call the new system (`highlight()`/`unhighlight()`) directly
   - Added log statements to indicate the deprecation when verbose logging is enabled

4. **Script Loading Prevention**:
   - Commented out the script loading in index.html to prevent the TurnIndicator class from being available
   - This ensures that no new TurnIndicator instances can be created

## Benefits
1. **Visual Clarity**: Only one turn indicator system appears now, eliminating confusion and visual clutter
2. **Code Cleanliness**: The new system uses proper component delegation and follows the established architecture
3. **Performance**: Removes unnecessary object creation and animations
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Any code calling the old methods still works through redirection to the new system
5. **Documentation Preservation**: Original implementation is preserved in comments for future reference

## Future Improvements
As mentioned in the task description, the next phase will be to enhance the new card frame turn indicator to make the card frame brighter instead of just pulsing. This will involve modifying the `CardFrameInteractionComponent.js` file to adjust the visual feedback for active turns.

## Testing Considerations
This change should be tested by:
1. Verifying that only the card frame pulse appears during battles
2. Confirming no errors occur related to missing TurnIndicator class or methods
3. Ensuring character turns are still clearly indicated throughout battle
4. Checking that there are no console errors related to the TurnIndicator system

## Lessons Learned
1. **Component Isolation**: Proper component isolation makes it easier to replace one visual system with another
2. **Deprecation Strategy**: Using a "comment-out" approach instead of complete code removal provides better backward compatibility
3. **Method Redirection**: Redirecting old methods to new functionality minimizes the impact of architectural changes
4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear explanations in comments help future developers understand the transition
