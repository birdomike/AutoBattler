# Technical Changelog: v0.5.27.1_Cleanup - PassiveTriggerTracker Cleanup

## Overview
This update completes the Stage 6 refactoring for the PassiveTriggerTracker component by removing the original toggle mechanism and tracking code from BattleManager. This cleanup significantly reduces code complexity while maintaining the same functionality, now delegated to the specialized PassiveTriggerTracker component.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Toggle Mechanism Removal
- Removed all `useNewImplementation` conditions when checking for PassiveTriggerTracker
- Replaced with direct component availability checks (`if (this.passiveTriggerTracker)`)
- Added appropriate warning messages when component is unavailable

### 2. Original Tracking Code Removal
- Removed per-character tracking with `character.passiveTriggeredThisTurn` objects
- Removed battle-level tracking with `this.passiveTriggersThisBattle` Map
- Eliminated initialization code for both tracking structures
- Removed manual tracking for battle start triggers

### 3. Fallback Behavior Implementation
- Implemented permissive fallback when tracker is unavailable (default to allowing triggers)
- This ensures passives still work even if component is missing, albeit without duplicate prevention
- Added clear console warnings to signal when tracker is unavailable

### 4. Simplified Methods
- Streamlined battle tracking reset in `startBattle()`
- Streamlined turn tracking reset in `startNextTurn()`
- Simplified trigger tracking in `processPassiveAbilities()`

## Code Changes

### Removed from startBattle():
```javascript
if (this.useNewImplementation && this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
} else {
    // Reset legacy tracking
    this.passiveTriggersThisBattle = new Map();
}
```

### Replaced with:
```javascript
if (this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    this.passiveTriggerTracker.resetBattleTracking();
} else {
    console.warn("[BattleManager] PassiveTriggerTracker not available for battle reset");
}
```

### Removed from processPassiveAbilities():
```javascript
// Initialize tracking for passives
if (this.useNewImplementation && this.passiveTriggerTracker) {
    // Use the new component for tracking
    // No need to initialize character.passiveTriggeredThisTurn
} else {
    // Original implementation - Initialize tracking object if it doesn't exist
    if (!character.passiveTriggeredThisTurn) {
        character.passiveTriggeredThisTurn = {};
    }
    
    // Initialize battle-level tracking if needed
    if (!this.passiveTriggersThisBattle) {
        this.passiveTriggersThisBattle = new Map();
    }
}
```

### Metrics

- Total lines of code removed: 57
- Total lines of code added: 19
- Net reduction: 38 lines
- Complexity reduction: Eliminated manual tracking with Maps and per-character objects

## Testing Notes

The changes preserve the exact same functionality as before, but with cleaner code:

1. Passive abilities still trigger correctly for all trigger types
2. Duplicate triggers are still prevented (for the same turn/battle as appropriate)
3. onBattleStart triggers still work correctly (once per battle)
4. Battle log messages for passive ability activations remain unchanged
5. Even if PassiveTriggerTracker is unavailable, passive abilities will still work

## Implementation Approach

This implementation follows the same "Extract-Verify-Remove" pattern that proved successful in previous stages:
1. Extract functionality into specialized component (completed in v0.5.27.1)
2. Verify both implementations work with toggle (tested in v0.5.27.1)
3. Remove original implementation and replace with clean facade (this update)

The result is a more maintainable, focused BattleManager that delegates specific functionality to dedicated components.
