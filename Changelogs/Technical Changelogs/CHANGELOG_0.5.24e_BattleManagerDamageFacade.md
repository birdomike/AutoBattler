# Version 0.5.24d: BattleManager Damage Facade - Technical Changelog

## Overview
This update completes the Stage 4 damage system refactoring by converting the remaining direct implementation of `BattleManager.applyDamage()` to a proper facade method that delegates to the `DamageCalculator` component. It also cleans up legacy status effect processing to further reduce BattleManager complexity.

## Problem
During Stage 4 refactoring:
- We successfully extracted damage application logic into `DamageCalculator.applyDamage()`
- We updated `BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()` to use this new method
- We missed updating the standalone `BattleManager.applyDamage()` method, which is used by other systems (e.g., status effects) to apply damage outside the normal action flow
- Additionally, we still had toggle-based legacy code for status effect processing that could be removed

This resulted in duplicate damage application logic and violated our refactoring goal of moving all damage-related functionality into specialized components.

## Implementation Details

### BattleManager.js Changes

#### 1. Damage Facade Implementation
- Replaced the original `applyDamage` implementation with a thin facade that delegates to `DamageCalculator`
- Added defensive validation that matches the original method's early returns
- Implemented fallback behavior if `DamageCalculator` is not available
- Ensured the method signature remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- Maintained the same return value structure: `{ actualDamage, killed }`

#### 2. Status Effect Processing Cleanup
- Removed the toggle-based implementation of `processStatusEffects`
- Eliminated ~120 lines of legacy status effect processing code
- Replaced with a clean implementation that directly delegates to `StatusEffectManager`
- Added defensive checks to ensure the StatusEffectManager is available before delegation

### Benefits
1. **Eliminates Duplication**: All damage application logic now resides in a single location
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Changes to damage application only need to be made in one place
3. **Complete Separation of Concerns**: BattleManager no longer directly implements damage calculation or application
4. **Consistent Architecture**: Follows the same facade pattern used for other extracted methods

## Testing Notes
The implementation was tested with the following focus areas:

1. **Direct Method Usage**: Verified that direct calls to `BattleManager.applyDamage()` function correctly
2. **Status Effect Processing**: Tested damage-over-time status effects that use this method
3. **UI Updates**: Confirmed health bars and floating damage numbers display correctly
4. **Event Handling**: Verified that CHARACTER_DAMAGED events are properly dispatched

## Conclusion
This update completes the Stage 4 refactoring by ensuring all damage calculation and application logic is properly encapsulated within specialized components, maintaining our refactoring goal of transforming BattleManager from a monolithic class into a thin coordination layer.
