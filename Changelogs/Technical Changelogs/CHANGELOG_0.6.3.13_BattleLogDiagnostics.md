# Technical Changelog: Battle Log Diagnostics (v0.6.3.13)

## Overview

Added diagnostic logging to track the flow of action declarations through the Battle Log system to help identify why action declarations might be missing or duplicated in the Battle Log UI.

## Problem Analysis

The Battle Log was not consistently showing action declarations such as "Character uses [Ability] on Target". The issue appeared to be related to the flow of these messages through multiple components:

1. Action generation in ActionGenerator.js 
2. Action execution in BattleFlowController.executeNextAction()
3. Effect application in BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()
4. Message display via BattleLogManager.logMessage()

The debugging was focused on determining where in this chain the messages might be lost or duplicated.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added action object logging in BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()

```javascript
// At the start of BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()
console.log(`[BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect] Entered. Action received:`, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(action)));
```

This allows us to inspect the full action object as it enters the method, including:
- actor information
- target information
- ability details
- action type and other properties

### 2. Added pre-log message tracking in BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect()

```javascript
// Before calling this.battleManager.logMessage() with the action declaration
console.log(`[BattleFlowController.applyActionEffect] PRE-LOG: Action Declaration: "${actionDeclaration}", Type: "action"`);
```

This shows the exact message and type being sent to the BattleLogManager, allowing us to confirm if proper formatting is occurring.

### 3. Added message reception tracking in BattleLogManager.logMessage()

```javascript
// At the start of BattleLogManager.logMessage()
console.log(`[BattleLogManager.logMessage] Received to display: "${message}", Type: "${type}"`);
```

This confirms that messages are actually reaching the BattleLogManager and what their content looks like when they arrive.

## Expected Diagnostic Output

The debugging logs should show:
1. The complete action object structure in BattleFlowController
2. The formatted action declaration message before it's sent to the log
3. Confirmation that the message was received by BattleLogManager

By examining these logs, we can identify:
- If multiple similar messages are being generated for the same action
- If messages are being lost between components
- If the formatting of messages is inconsistent or incorrect

## Testing Plan

To fully diagnose the issue:

1. Start a battle with player and enemy teams
2. Observe the console logs for each character action
3. Compare the logged messages with what appears in the Battle Log UI
4. Look for duplicates or missing messages in the sequence of logs

## Next Steps

After collecting diagnostic information, potential fixes may include:
- Removing duplicate log calls if they exist
- Ensuring consistent message formatting
- Addressing any issues with message transmission between components
