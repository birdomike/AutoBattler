# Changelog: Image Preloading Synchronization

## Version 0.6.7.7 - May 12, 2025

### Overview
This update resolves a race condition that was causing "TeamBuilderImageLoader: [CharacterName] not found in image cache" errors during game startup. The issue occurred because UI components (like HeroGridManager) were attempting to use character images before TeamBuilderImageLoader had finished loading them. The solution implements Promise-based image preloading and proper sequencing, ensuring all necessary images are loaded before UI rendering begins.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Promise-Based Image Preloading
Modified `TeamBuilderImageLoader.preloadCharacterImages()` to return a Promise that resolves only when all images have been loaded (or failed to load):

```javascript
preloadCharacterImages() {
    // Create an array of promises, one for each image
    const loadPromises = charactersWithArt.map(characterName => {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            try {
                // Image loading logic...
                img.onload = () => {
                    // Cache the image...
                    resolve(); // Resolve this image's promise
                };
                img.onerror = (err) => {
                    // Log error...
                    resolve(); // Resolve even on error
                };
                // Start loading
                img.src = imagePath;
            } catch (err) {
                resolve(); // Resolve even if there's an exception
            }
        });
    });
    
    // Return a promise that resolves when ALL images are loaded
    return Promise.all(loadPromises).then(() => {
        console.log('TeamBuilderImageLoader: All character images have been processed');
        // Additional setup...
    });
}
```

This implementation has several key features:
- Creates a separate promise for each image to be loaded
- Properly handles both successful loads and errors
- Ensures all images are at least attempted to be loaded before resolving
- Uses `Promise.all()` to wait for all individual promises to resolve

#### 2. Awaitable Initialization
Modified `TeamBuilderImageLoader.initialize()` to return the promise from `preloadCharacterImages()`:

```javascript
async initialize() {
    // Load character data...
    // Start periodic checking...
    // Do an initial check...
    
    // Return the promise from preloadCharacterImages()
    return this.preloadCharacterImages();
}
```

This change enables other components to know when initialization and preloading is complete, rather than assuming it happens instantaneously.

#### 3. Proper UI Initialization Sequencing
Updated `TeamBuilderUI.initialize()` to await the completion of image preloading before initializing UI components:

```javascript
async initialize() {
    // Load heroes data...
    
    // Initialize the image loader and AWAIT its completion
    await this.initializeImageLoader();
    
    console.log('TeamBuilderUI: Image preloading complete, initializing UI components...');
    
    // Only now initialize UI components
    await this.initializeHeroDetailManager();
    await this.initializeFilterManager();
    // etc...
    
    // And finally render UI elements
    this.renderFilters();
    this.renderHeroGrid();
    // etc...
}
```

This ensures that UI components only begin rendering after all images are preloaded.

#### 4. Fallback On-Demand Loading
Enhanced `TeamBuilderImageLoader.drawArt()` to handle cases where images aren't in the cache by loading them on-demand:

```javascript
// If image not in cache, attempt to load it immediately
if (!window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName]) {
    console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: ${characterName} not found in image cache, loading now...`);
    // Create and load the image immediately
    const img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => {
        window.CHARACTER_IMAGE_CACHE[characterName] = img;
        console.log(`TeamBuilderImageLoader: ${characterName}'s image loaded on-demand`);
        // Force redraw now that the image is loaded
        this.drawArt(character, container, isDetailViewContext);
    };
    img.src = this.characterImages[characterName];
    
    // Show loading indicator in the meantime
    this.drawLoadingPlaceholder(container, isDetailViewContext);
    return true;
}
```

This provides a graceful fallback for any edge cases where an image might be needed before it's loaded, ensuring that something is still displayed to the user.

#### 5. Loading Placeholder
Added a new `drawLoadingPlaceholder()` method to show visual feedback while images are loading:

```javascript
drawLoadingPlaceholder(container, isDetailViewContext) {
    // Create a placeholder div with loading text
    const placeholder = document.createElement('div');
    placeholder.className = 'loading-placeholder';
    placeholder.style.position = 'absolute';
    placeholder.style.display = 'flex';
    // Set appropriate styling...
    placeholder.textContent = 'Loading...';
    // Add to container...
}
```

This improves user experience by providing visual feedback for loading operations.

### Implementation Challenges

#### 1. Error Handling
One challenge was ensuring that errors during image loading wouldn't block the entire chain of promises. We addressed this by:
- Resolving each image's promise even if there's an error loading that image
- Providing comprehensive error logging
- Using try/catch blocks to handle unexpected exceptions

#### 2. Promise Sequencing
Ensuring the proper sequence of operations (load data → preload images → initialize UI → render) required careful attention to async/await flow:
- Each component method returns a promise that next steps can await
- UI initialization now explicitly waits for image preloading completion
- Log messages mark clear transitions between phases

#### 3. Maintaining Backwards Compatibility
We had to ensure the code remained compatible with existing systems:
- Returning `Promise.resolve()` in error cases to maintain expected Promise chains
- Providing fallback behavior for any images not loaded during preload
- Maintaining existing observer and callback patterns for older code

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Elimination of Errors**: Users no longer see "not found in image cache" errors in the console during startup.

2. **Consistent Image Display**: All character images appear immediately when the UI is first rendered.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading placeholders provide visual feedback if any images need to be loaded on-demand.

4. **Improved Stability**: The more robust architecture reduces the chance of visual glitches or missing art.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Initial Load Time**: There may be a slightly longer initial loading time as the game now explicitly waits for all images to preload before rendering UI.

2. **Resource Efficiency**: By using Promise.all, all images load in parallel rather than sequentially, optimizing network usage.

3. **Memory Usage**: The caching strategy remains unchanged, maintaining the same memory footprint as before.

### Future Considerations

1. **Loading Indicator**: A more sophisticated loading indicator could be added to show overall preloading progress.

2. **Prioritized Loading**: Images could be loaded in priority order (e.g., team builder UI images first, then battle images).

3. **Caching Strategy**: Future updates could implement a more sophisticated caching strategy, potentially using browser cache or IndexedDB for persistent caching.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Promise-Based Loading**: Asynchronous image loading should always be handled with Promises rather than callbacks for better flow control.

2. **Sequential Dependencies**: When components depend on resources being loaded, explicit sequencing is necessary rather than assuming resources will be available.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Adding fallback mechanisms (on-demand loading) provides resilience against edge cases.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Always provide visual feedback for loading operations to improve user experience.

This change addresses the immediate image loading issues and provides a more robust foundation for all asynchronous operations in the TeamBuilder UI.
