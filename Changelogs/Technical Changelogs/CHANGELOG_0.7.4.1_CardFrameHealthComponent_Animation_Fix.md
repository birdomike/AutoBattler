# CHANGELOG 0.7.4.1 - CardFrameHealthComponent Animation Fix

## Overview
This update resolves an issue with the CardFrameHealthComponent that was causing "Invalid percentage value" warnings in the console. The root cause was related to how health percentage was being calculated during animations, specifically by incorrectly using the `.width` property of a Phaser Graphics object.

## Problem Analysis

After careful investigation, we identified that the warning was occurring in the following scenario:

1. In the `updateHealth()` method, the code was attempting to use `this.healthBar.width` to determine the starting percentage for animations:
   ```javascript
   const oldWidth = this.healthBar.width;
   // Later...
   this._startHealthPercent = oldWidth / barWidth;
   ```

2. However, `this.healthBar` is a Phaser Graphics object which doesn't automatically track its width as a property. When shapes are drawn with a Graphics object, the `.width` property doesn't get updated, resulting in `undefined`.

3. This caused `this._startHealthPercent` to become `undefined / barWidth`, which equals `NaN`.

4. During animation, this NaN value was passed to:
   ```javascript
   const currentPercent = Phaser.Math.Linear(
       this._startHealthPercent,  // This was NaN
       this._targetHealthPercent,
       dummyObj.progress
   );
   ```

5. Finally, this NaN value was passed to `getHealthBarColor()`, triggering the warning because it's not a valid number.

## Implementation Solution

The fix involved several steps:

1. **Added Health Percentage Tracking**:
   ```javascript
   // Track current health percentage for smooth animations
   this._currentHealthPercent = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 
       this.config.values.current / Math.max(1, this.config.values.max)
   ));
   ```

2. **Used Tracked Percentage Instead of Graphics Width**:
   ```javascript
   // Store previous health percentage for animation
   const previousHealthPercent = this._currentHealthPercent;
   
   // In animation setup
   this._startHealthPercent = previousHealthPercent;
   ```

3. **Improved Validation in getHealthBarColor**:
   ```javascript
   // Enhanced validation for percent with better fallback
   if (percent === undefined || percent === null || typeof percent !== 'number' || isNaN(percent)) {
       console.warn('CardFrameHealthComponent.getHealthBarColor: Invalid percentage value, using current health percentage');
       // Use tracked health percentage as fallback instead of defaulting to green
       percent = this._currentHealthPercent || 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Added Division by Zero Protection**:
   Added `Math.max(1, this.config.values.max)` throughout to prevent division by zero situations.

5. **Enhanced _updateHealthBarGraphics** with defensive validation:
   ```javascript
   // Validate the health percent (defensive programming)
   if (healthPercent === undefined || healthPercent === null || typeof healthPercent !== 'number' || isNaN(healthPercent)) {
       console.warn('CardFrameHealthComponent._updateHealthBarGraphics: Invalid percentage value, using current tracked percentage');
       healthPercent = this._currentHealthPercent || 0;
   }
   ```

## Testing Results

The fix was tested successfully with:
- Health decreasing (taking damage)
- Health increasing (healing)
- Multiple rapid health changes
- Edge cases (near 0 and full health)

The warning "CardFrameHealthComponent.getHealthBarColor: Invalid percentage value" no longer appears in the console, and health bar animations now smoothly transition between states.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Graphics Object Properties**: Phaser Graphics objects don't automatically maintain width/height properties when shapes are drawn. Always use explicit tracking for such values.

2. **Fallback Values**: Using current/previous state values as fallbacks for invalid inputs provides more graceful degradation than arbitrary defaults.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Validation in multiple places provides redundancy that prevents cascading errors, especially during animations.

4. **State Tracking**: Explicitly tracking state (like health percentage) rather than trying to derive it from visual properties creates more reliable animations.

5. **Division Protection**: Always guard against division by zero, even in cases where it seems unlikely.

The fix maintains compatibility with the existing component architecture while improving stability and user experience.
