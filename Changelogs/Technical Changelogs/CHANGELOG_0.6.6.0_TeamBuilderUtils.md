# CHANGELOG 0.6.6.0 - TeamBuilderUI Refactoring Phase 1: TeamBuilderUtils

## Overview

This update implements Phase 1 of a comprehensive refactoring plan for TeamBuilderUI.js. In this initial phase, we've extracted common utility functions into a new TeamBuilderUtils component, laying the foundation for our component-based architecture.

The refactoring follows an Extract-Verify-Remove pattern, with this update representing the Extract and Verify stages. In this phase, we've created the TeamBuilderUtils component and updated TeamBuilderUI to use it, while maintaining the original implementations for verification before removal.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created TeamBuilderUtils.js

A new utility class has been created at `js/ui/teambuilder/TeamBuilderUtils.js` containing the following static methods:

1. **splitTypes** - Handles multi-type string parsing (e.g., "water/ice" â†’ ["water", "ice"])
2. **renderMultiTypeSpans** - Renders type spans with proper formatting and separators
3. **getOrdinalSuffix** - Gets ordinal suffixes for numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
4. **createStatBox** - Creates stat box UI elements with consistent styling
5. **getDetailedScalingText** - Generates ability scaling descriptions for tooltips

These utility functions were extracted directly from TeamBuilderUI.js, maintaining their exact functionality but converting them from instance methods to static methods.

### 2. Updated HTML and Script Loading

Modified `index.html` to load TeamBuilderUtils.js before TeamBuilderUI.js:

```html
<script src="js/ui/teambuilder/TeamBuilderUtils.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/ui/TeamBuilderUI.js" defer></script>
```

This ensures TeamBuilderUtils is available when TeamBuilderUI initializes.

### 3. Updated TeamBuilderUI.js

Modified TeamBuilderUI.js to use the TeamBuilderUtils versions of the utility functions while keeping the original implementations:

```javascript
// Before
const types = this.splitTypes(hero.type);

// After
const types = TeamBuilderUtils.splitTypes(hero.type);
```

Key updates:
- Updated all `this.splitTypes(...)` calls to `TeamBuilderUtils.splitTypes(...)`
- Updated all `this.renderMultiTypeSpans(...)` calls to `TeamBuilderUtils.renderMultiTypeSpans(..., this.typeColors)`
- Updated all `this.getOrdinalSuffix(...)` calls to `TeamBuilderUtils.getOrdinalSuffix(...)`
- Updated all `this.createStatBox(...)` calls to `TeamBuilderUtils.createStatBox(...)`
- Updated all `this.getDetailedScalingText(...)` calls to `TeamBuilderUtils.getDetailedScalingText(...)`

### 4. Created Component Architecture Documentation

Created a README.md file in the teambuilder directory that outlines:
- The component architecture plan
- Component responsibilities and interfaces
- Dependencies between components
- Planned phases for future refactoring

## Technical Considerations

### Parameter Adaptations

Some methods required additional parameters when moved to static utils:

- `renderMultiTypeSpans` now takes a `typeColors` parameter since it no longer has access to `this.typeColors`

### TeamBuilderUtils Export Pattern

The TeamBuilderUtils class uses a global export pattern to make it accessible to traditional script loading:

```javascript
// Make utilities available globally for traditional scripts
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.TeamBuilderUtils = TeamBuilderUtils;
  console.log("TeamBuilderUtils loaded and exported to window.TeamBuilderUtils");
}
```

This approach maintains compatibility with the current codebase without requiring module imports.

## Testing Considerations

After implementing Phase 1, the following should be tested:
1. Team builder UI loads correctly with no console errors
2. Character grid displays correctly with multi-type characters
3. Team slots display correctly with multi-type characters
4. Hero details panel shows correct type tags, stats boxes, and ability tooltips
5. No visual or functional differences compared to pre-refactoring version

## Next Steps

After successful verification of this phase, Phase 1 will conclude with:

1. **Remove**: Removing the original method implementations from TeamBuilderUI.js:
   - `splitTypes` method
   - `renderMultiTypeSpans` method
   - `getOrdinalSuffix` method
   - `createStatBox` method
   - `getDetailedScalingText` method

This will be followed by Phase 2, which will focus on extracting the HeroDetailPanelManager component.

## Refactoring Metrics

- **New Files Created**: 2
  - `js/ui/teambuilder/TeamBuilderUtils.js` (~160 lines)
  - `js/ui/teambuilder/README.md` (~120 lines)
- **Files Modified**: 2
  - `index.html` (+1 line)
  - `TeamBuilderUI.js` (no lines removed yet, references updated)
- **Lines of Code Refactored**: 104 lines extracted (to be removed in the next stage)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Testing**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allows for thorough testing before removing original implementations, reducing risk.

2. **Utility Function Centralization**: Centralizing utility functions immediately demonstrates value by revealing duplication and establishing consistent patterns.

3. **Parameter Adaptations**: When converting instance methods to static, careful attention must be paid to dependencies on instance properties like `this.typeColors`.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: This initial refactoring already helps clarify the responsibilities of TeamBuilderUI vs. utility functions, guiding future component extraction.
