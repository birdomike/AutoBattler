# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.1 - Phaser Battle Scene Core Infrastructure

## Overview
This update implements Phase 1 of the Battle Scene Implementation Plan, focusing on Core Infrastructure. The update includes the creation of a folder structure for Phaser components, debugging tools, and the initial implementation of the BattleScene with event handling and animation testing capabilities.

## Technical Details

### 1. Project Structure Updates
- Created folder structure for Phaser components:
  - `js/phaser/components/battle/` - For battle-specific components
  - `js/phaser/debug/` - For debugging utilities
  - `js/phaser/bridge/` - For communication bridges between systems
  - `js/phaser/scenes/` - For Phaser scenes

### 2. Debug Tools Implementation
- Created `CoordinateDisplay.js` - Grid overlay system with configurable spacing and mouse position tracking
  - Features keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+G) to toggle the grid
  - Displays coordinate readout that follows mouse position
  - Customizable grid spacing and color
  - Implemented as a separate class for reusability

- Created `ObjectIdentifier.js` - Game object inspection tool
  - Highlights objects under the mouse cursor
  - Displays detailed information about hovered objects
  - Allows pinning objects to continuously monitor their properties
  - Supports keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+I) to toggle object information
  - Creates interactive info panels for pinned objects

- Implemented debug control panel within the BattleScene
  - Toggle buttons for grid and object info
  - Test animation button
  - Keyboard shortcut reference
  - Toggle visibility with (Ctrl+D)

### 3. Battle Bridge System
- Created `BattleBridge.js` - Communication layer between BattleManager and Phaser BattleScene
  - Implemented comprehensive event system
  - Patches BattleManager methods to emit events
  - Provides methods for bi-directional communication
  - Handles battle state synchronization

### 4. BattleScene Foundation
- Implemented basic `BattleScene.js` with lifecycle methods:
  - Preload, create, update methods
  - Debug tool initialization
  - Sample character rendering for testing
  - Battle event handlers (onBattleStarted, onBattleEnded, etc.)
  - Test animation feature between characters

### 5. TeamBuilder UI Updates
- Created `TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js` to patch the existing TeamBuilderUI
  - Added method to transition to Phaser-based battle scene
  - Implemented controlled transition between DOM UI and Phaser canvas
  - Added return handling to properly restore UI state

### 6. Animation Test System
- Added sample animation test system
  - Character attack animation with proper movement path
  - Health bar reduction animation
  - Floating damage numbers with tweening
  - Flash effect on damaged character

## Implementation Notes
- Used proper inheritance and initialization patterns to ensure clean integration
- Applied defensive programming with try/catch blocks for robustness
- Used Phaser's event system for communication between components
- Made all debug tools keyboard-accessible
- Ensured all created objects are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

## Next Steps
- Implement ObjectIdentifier.js - a tool for identifying and inspecting Phaser game objects (v0.5.0.2)
- Create a Debug Configuration Manager for controlling global debug settings (v0.5.0.3)
- Implement an Interactive Layout Debugger for positioning UI elements (v0.5.0.4)
- Complete the BattleScene-BattleManager Bridge implementation (v0.5.0.5-0.5.0.6)
