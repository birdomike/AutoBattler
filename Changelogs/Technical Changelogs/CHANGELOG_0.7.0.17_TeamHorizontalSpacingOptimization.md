# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.17 - Team Horizontal Spacing Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The player and enemy teams were positioned too close together horizontally on the battle screen, creating visual crowding and making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams. The previous configuration placed:

- Player team at x-position 800
- Enemy team at x-position 1200

This created a gap of only 400 pixels between team center points, which was insufficient with the new card-based representation that requires more visual space for proper display and clarity.

## Implementation Solution

The solution involved adjusting the team positions in `TeamDisplayManager.js` to increase horizontal spacing while maintaining the center point of the battle area (x=1000):

1. **Moved Player Team Further Left**:
   - Changed player team's x-position from 800 to 600 (moved 200px to the left)

2. **Moved Enemy Team Further Right**:
   - Changed enemy team's x-position from 1200 to 1400 (moved 200px to the right)

### Code Changes

```javascript
// Previous positions in TeamDisplayManager.js
this.playerTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.playerTeam,
    true, // isPlayerTeam
    { x: 800, y: 600 } // Original position
);

this.enemyTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.enemyTeam,
    false, // not player team
    { x: 1200, y: 600 } // Original position
);

// Updated positions in TeamDisplayManager.js
this.playerTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.playerTeam,
    true, // isPlayerTeam
    { x: 600, y: 600 } // Moved left from 800 to 600
);

this.enemyTeamContainer = new window.TeamContainer(
    this.scene,
    this.enemyTeam,
    false, // not player team
    { x: 1400, y: 600 } // Moved right from 1200 to 1400
);
```

## Technical Details

- Changed positions in `TeamDisplayManager.js`, not in `TeamContainer.js`, because the TeamDisplayManager overrides the default positions defined in TeamContainer
- Maintained the center point of the battle area at x=1000 to keep the overall layout balanced
- Doubled the gap between teams from 400px to 800px for clearer visual separation
- Preserved all other positioning aspects such as y-coordinates and vertical spacing

## Visual Improvements

This adjustment yields several key improvements:

1. **Clearer Team Distinction**: Greater horizontal separation makes it immediately obvious which team is which
2. **Reduced Visual Crowding**: More space between teams prevents visual overlap during attack animations
3. **Better Focus on Active Team**: With more separation, highlighting the active team becomes more effective
4. **Improved Card Visibility**: Each card has more room to be viewed without competing visually with the opposing team

## Testing Results

The increased team spacing provides a more balanced and visually distinct battle layout. Teams are now clearly separated while maintaining the center point of the battle area. This change complements the previous card layout optimizations (moving health bar to top and nameplate to bottom) by giving the cards more room to be properly displayed.

## Next Steps

While this change significantly improves the horizontal team spacing, additional enhancements that could be considered include:

1. **Responsive Positioning**: Implementing dynamic positioning based on screen size for better support across different devices
2. **Configuration Option**: Adding a configurable spacing parameter to easily adjust the gap between teams based on the number of characters
3. **Visual Connection**: Adding subtle visual elements to reinforce team identity, such as team-colored platforms or background elements
