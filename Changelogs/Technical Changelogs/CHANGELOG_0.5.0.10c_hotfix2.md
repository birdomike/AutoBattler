# CHANGELOG 0.5.0.10c Hotfix 2 - Battle Log Text Visibility Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses the issues with the Battle Log UI where the log panel was visible but the text wasn't showing properly, and errors were occurring when processing status effect messages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Status Effect Display Errors

#### Problem
The BattleLogPanel was correctly loaded and initialized, but there were recurring errors when trying to display status effect messages:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
at BattleLogPanel.js:256
```

#### Solution
- Added defensive error handling in the status effect event handler
- Implemented multiple fallback paths for accessing status effect names
- Added proper error catching to prevent errors from blocking other messages
- Made text display more robust against various data formats

#### Code Changes
- Updated the `STATUS_EFFECT_APPLIED` event handler with extensive error handling
- Added similar error handling to other event handlers for consistency
- Improved the status effect name formatting to handle various formats

### 2. Enhanced Battle Log Visual Appearance

#### Problem
The Battle Log panel was present but text was not sufficiently visible on the background.

#### Solution
- Increased text contrast and visibility with text shadows, strokes, and larger font size
- Enhanced the log panel background and border with more contrast and opacity
- Made important messages (action, error, success) bold for better visibility
- Adjusted title bar and title text to stand out more

#### Code Changes
- Enhanced text rendering with stroke, shadow and improved styling
- Made title bar brighter blue (0x3366aa) with more opacity (0.95)
- Increased border thickness to 3px with blue color (0x4488ff)
- Updated message colors to brighter variants for better visibility
- Made the log panel background more opaque (0.95 vs 0.85) and slightly blue-tinted

## Technical Notes

### Error Handling Strategy
- Added try/catch blocks around event handlers to isolate errors
- Used defensive property access patterns to handle varying data structures
- Implemented fallback messages when specific data is unavailable
- Added detailed warning logs to help with future debugging

### Visual Enhancements
- Text with shadows and strokes for better readability
- Bold styling for important messages
- Increased font size from 14px to 16px
- Added text shadow and stroke details to improve contrast
- Brighter, more saturated colors for message types

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start a battle and verify that the Battle Log text is now visible
2. Check that status effects are correctly displayed without errors
3. Verify that different message types (action, info, success, error) have appropriate color coding
4. Check that the title "Battle Log" is clearly visible

## Known Limitations
- Some system messages from BattleManager might not be perfectly formatted
- Very long messages might still be cut off in the display area
