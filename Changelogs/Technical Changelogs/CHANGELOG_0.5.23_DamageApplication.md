# Version 0.5.23: Damage Application Extraction - Technical Changelog

## Overview
This update continues Stage 4 of the BattleManager refactoring plan by extracting the damage application logic from BattleManager/BattleFlowController into the DamageCalculator component. This represents another step in our effort to break up the monolithic BattleManager class into more focused, single-responsibility components.

The main goals of this refactoring were:
1. Add an `applyDamage` method to DamageCalculator to handle the actual application of damage to characters
2. Implement a clear separation of concerns: DamageCalculator applies damage but doesn't set defeat state
3. Handle event dispatching consistently for CHARACTER_DAMAGED events
4. Maintain backward compatibility using the toggle mechanism during the transition

## Implementation Details

### 1. DamageCalculator Component Enhancement

Added a new `applyDamage` method to the DamageCalculator class:

```javascript
/**
 * Applies damage to a target character
 * @param {Object} target - The character receiving damage
 * @param {number} amount - The amount of damage to apply
 * @param {Object} source - The character or entity causing the damage
 * @param {Object} ability - The ability used to cause the damage (optional)
 * @param {string} damageType - The type of damage being dealt (physical, spell, etc.)
 * @returns {Object} Object containing actualDamage and killed status
 */
applyDamage(target, amount, source, ability, damageType) {
    // Validate input parameters
    if (!target || typeof amount !== 'number') {
        console.error('[DamageCalculator] Invalid parameters for applyDamage:', { target, amount });
        return { actualDamage: 0, killed: false };
    }

    // Store old health for comparison
    const oldHealth = target.currentHp;
    
    // Apply damage to target (minimum health is 0)
    target.currentHp = Math.max(0, target.currentHp - Math.max(0, amount));
    
    // Calculate actual damage done (after applying to health)
    const actualDamage = oldHealth - target.currentHp;
    
    // Determine if character was killed by this damage (but don't set isDefeated)
    const killed = oldHealth > 0 && target.currentHp <= 0;
    
    // Dispatch damage event
    if (window.battleBridge && actualDamage > 0) {
        try {
            window.battleBridge.dispatchEvent(
                window.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, 
                {
                    character: target,
                    target: target,
                    newHealth: target.currentHp,
                    maxHealth: target.stats.hp,
                    amount: actualDamage,
                    source: source,
                    ability: ability
                }
            );
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('[DamageCalculator] Error dispatching CHARACTER_DAMAGED event:', error);
        }
    }
    
    // Return both the actual damage dealt and whether it would kill the target
    return { actualDamage, killed };
}
```

Key improvements in this implementation:
- Returns an object with both `actualDamage` and `killed` status instead of just the damage amount
- Uses the difference between old and new health to calculate actual damage done
- Handles dispatch of CHARACTER_DAMAGED events directly
- Detects killed state without setting the `isDefeated` flag (left to BattleFlowController)
- Includes comprehensive input validation and error handling

### 2. BattleFlowController Refactoring

Modified the BattleFlowController's `applyActionEffect` method to use the new DamageCalculator.applyDamage method:

```javascript
// Using new implementation with DamageCalculator
if (this.battleManager.useNewImplementation && this.battleManager.damageCalculator) {
    // Use the new extracted method
    const result = this.battleManager.damageCalculator.applyDamage(
        action.target,
        action.damage,
        action.actor,
        action.ability,
        action.damageType || 'physical'
    );
    
    // Store the result values
    actualDamage = result.actualDamage;
    killed = result.killed;
} else {
    // Original implementation
    // ...
}
```

The key improvements:
1. Clear separation of concerns between components:
   - DamageCalculator: Applies damage, calculates actual damage, detects if character would be killed
   - BattleFlowController: Handles the consequences of damage (defeat state, passive triggers)
2. Enhanced defeat logic that now checks the `killed` status from DamageCalculator:
   ```javascript
   if (killed) {
       action.target.isDefeated = true;
       action.target.currentHp = 0; // Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
       // Process defeat passive abilities...
       // Process on-kill passive ability...
   }
   ```

### 3. Property Standardization

Standardized the use of `isDefeated` property throughout BattleFlowController replacing `isDead` for consistent terminology:

```javascript
// Changed from isDead to isDefeated in multiple places
if (action.actor.isDefeated || action.actor.currentHp <= 0) {
    // ...
}

if (!isHealing && (action.target.isDefeated || action.target.currentHp <= 0)) {
    // ...
}

const livingTargets = possibleTargets.filter(target => !target.isDefeated && target.currentHp > 0);
```

## Testing Notes

The implementation was tested with the following focus areas:

1. **Basic Damage Application**:
   - Verified health is reduced by the correct amount
   - Confirmed health bars update correctly in the UI
   - Ensured battle log shows accurate damage values

2. **Event Dispatching**:
   - Confirmed CHARACTER_DAMAGED events dispatch with correct payload
   - Verified UI components (health bars, damage numbers) update properly with both implementations

3. **Character Defeat**:
   - Validated defeat state is properly set in BattleFlowController
   - Confirmed battle log shows defeat messages
   - Verified passive abilities trigger correctly on kill/defeat

4. **Toggle Mechanism**:
   - Tested with useNewImplementation = true/false to confirm identical behavior
   - Verified graceful degradation when DamageCalculator is unavailable

## Additional Notes

This implementation represents an important step in the refactoring process by clearly separating:
1. Damage calculation (DamageCalculator.calculateDamage)
2. Damage application (DamageCalculator.applyDamage)
3. Defeat state management (BattleFlowController)

The pattern established here will be repeated for the upcoming extraction of the healing system in Version 0.5.24.

*Note: The next step in Stage 4 of the refactoring plan will be Version 0.5.23_Cleanup, which will remove the original damage application code from BattleFlowController after confirming the new implementation functions properly.*
