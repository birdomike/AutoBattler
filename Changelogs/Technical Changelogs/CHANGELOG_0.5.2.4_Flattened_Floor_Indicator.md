# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.2.4 - 2025-05-14

## Flattened Floor Indicator for Better Visual Appearance

This update enhances the turn indicator by flattening its shape to better represent a floor marker beneath characters.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Adjusted highlight ellipse dimensions:**

```javascript
// Before
this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset - 2, 80, 40, teamColor, 0.5);

// After
this.highlightEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset - 2, 110, 25, teamColor, 0.4);
```

**Adjusted shadow ellipse dimensions:**

```javascript
// Before
this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset, 90, 45, 0x000000, 0.4);

// After
this.shadowEffect = this.scene.add.ellipse(0, bottomOffset, 120, 30, 0x000000, 0.4);
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced 3D Perspective**:
   - Widened both ellipses to create a more oval shape
   - Reduced height to create the appearance of perspective (as if viewed at an angle)
   - Made shadow slightly larger than highlight for better depth effect
   - Reduced highlight opacity for subtler appearance

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Main highlight now 110x25 (was 80x40) - 38% wider, 38% shorter
   - Shadow now 120x30 (was 90x45) - 33% wider, 33% shorter
   - Maintained same vertical positioning for proper foot alignment
   - Reduced opacity from 0.5 to 0.4 for more subtle appearance

### Visual Effect

The flatter, wider ellipses create a more convincing floor marker effect by:
- Better representing the perspective of looking at a circle on the ground
- Enhancing the 3D illusion with proper shadow relationship
- Creating a more subtle indicator that doesn't compete visually with the characters
- Maintaining team color visibility while improving the sense of depth

This update completes the visual improvements to the turn indicator system, creating a polished, professional appearance that clearly indicates the active character without being visually distracting.
