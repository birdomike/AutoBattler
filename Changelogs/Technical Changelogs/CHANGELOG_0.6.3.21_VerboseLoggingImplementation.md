# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.21 - Verbose Logging Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a simple verbose logging system that moves specific debug logs behind a conditional flag. This allows detailed diagnostic information to remain in the codebase but only appear in the console when the verbose logging feature is enabled. The changes reduce console clutter during normal development and testing, while preserving the ability to see detailed logs when diagnosing specific issues.

## Implementation Details

### 1. VerboseLogging.js
Created a new utility file that defines a global flag for controlling verbose logging:

```javascript
/**
 * Simple verbose logging control
 * Set window.VERBOSE_LOGGING to true in the console to see verbose logs
 */
window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = false;

console.log("[VerboseLogging] Verbose logging is currently DISABLED. Set window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = true to enable.");
```

This flag can be toggled at runtime in the browser console by setting `window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = true` when needed.

### 2. Updated Files for Verbose Logging

#### 2.1 ActionGenerator.js
- Moved ability selection details to verbose logging
- Updated console log statements to check `window.VERBOSE_LOGGING` before executing
- Example pattern:
```javascript
if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) {
    console.debug(`[ActionGenerator] ${character.name} has ${availableAbilities.length} available active abilities`);
    console.log('[ActionGenerator.selectAbility] Available abilities:', availableAbilities.map(a => a.name));
}
```

#### 2.2 TargetingSystem.js
- Moved targeting resolution logs to verbose logging
- Comprehensive updates to all debug statements to be conditional
- Updated method signatures to maintain the same logging pattern
- Example pattern:
```javascript
if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) {
    console.log(`[TargetingSystem.processTargetingResult] Single target check: ${target.name} (HP: ${target.currentHp}, isDead: ${target.isDead}, Team: ${target.team}) - Valid: ${isValidSingleTarget}`);
}
```

#### 2.3 TeamDisplayManager.js
- Moved component state updates to verbose logging
- Conditional logging for global position calculations
- Example pattern:
```javascript
if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) {
    console.log(`[TeamDisplayManager] Global position calculated: ${xPos}, ${yPos}`);
}
```

#### 2.4 TeamContainer.js
- Added verbose conditional blocks around highlight clearing logs
- Updated character health update logging
- Example pattern:
```javascript
if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) {
    console.log(`TC.clearAllHighlights: Called for ${this.isPlayerTeam ? 'player' : 'enemy'} team, clearing highlights for ${this.characterSprites.length} sprites.`);
}
```

#### 2.5 ActionIndicator.js
- Conditional logging for position tracking and updates
- Maintained critical warnings outside of verbose mode
- Example pattern:
```javascript
if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) {
    console.log(`ActionIndicator.showAction: Text position after update: (${this.text.x}, ${this.text.y}) for character: ${this.parent?.character?.name || 'unknown'}`);
}
```

### 3. Impact on Codebase

The implementation follows these patterns:
1. Log statements that provide debugging context are now wrapped in `if (window.VERBOSE_LOGGING) { ... }` blocks
2. Error and warning logs that indicate problems remain unconditional
3. Basic status logs for critical operations remain unconditional
4. Logs related to specific subsystem details (targeting, ability selection, positioning, etc.) are now conditional

## Testing Process

The changes were tested as follows:
1. Verified that normal game operation shows a cleaner console with only essential information
2. Enabled verbose logging in the console (`window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = true`) and confirmed all diagnostic information reappears
3. Verified that warning and error logs still appear regardless of verbose setting
4. Checked that the console notification about verbose logging appears on game start

## User Guide

### For Developers
- To enable verbose logging during development, open your browser console and type:
```javascript
window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = true;
```
- To disable verbose logging, set the value to false:
```javascript
window.VERBOSE_LOGGING = false;
```

### Key Categories of Verbose Logs
1. **Ability Selection**: Detailed information about available abilities, selection logic, and decision making
2. **Targeting Resolution**: Debug information about target selection, validation, and final targets
3. **Team Management**: Team container highlighting, turn indication, and character lookups
4. **Positioning**: Detailed position calculations for UI elements like action indicators and turn markers
5. **Character Health**: Verbose health updates and character lookup diagnostics

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements to build on this system could include:
1. Multiple logging levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
2. Category-specific logging toggles (e.g., enable only targeting logs)
3. Log persistence to local storage
4. UI-based logging controls for easier toggling during development
5. Log file output via downloadable data

## Additional Notes

This change preserves all the valuable diagnostic information that was previously cluttering the console while making it optional. The logging statements themselves were left largely unchanged to preserve their diagnostic value, with only the conditional check added.

The simplicity of this approach (a global flag) makes it easy to understand and use, while more sophisticated logging could be implemented in the future if needed.
