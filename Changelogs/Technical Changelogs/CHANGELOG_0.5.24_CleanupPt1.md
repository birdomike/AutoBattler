# CHANGELOG_0.5.24_CleanupPt1 - BattleManager Legacy Code Removal

## Background
As part of our ongoing refactoring effort to transform BattleManager into a proper coordination layer, this update removes legacy methods and duplicate code that's no longer needed after previous refactoring stages.

## Changes Made

### Removed Legacy Methods
- Removed `_legacyStartNextTurn` method (~150 lines) - This functionality is now handled by BattleFlowController
- Removed `_legacyExecuteNextAction` method (~150 lines) - This functionality is now handled by BattleFlowController
- Removed `_legacyApplyActionEffect` method (~200 lines) - This functionality is now handled by BattleFlowController

### Resolved Duplicate Method Implementations
- Removed duplicate `applyDamage` method (kept the version that delegates to DamageCalculator)
- Removed duplicate `logMessage` method (kept the version that checks for battleLogManager delegation)

## Technical Notes
- These methods were marked with "DO NOT USE" comments and were preserved during previous refactoring steps for reference
- No functionality changes should be observed as these methods were not being called in the active code paths
- The elimination of approximately 600 lines of code significantly reduces the size of BattleManager.js
- This change maintains all existing functionality while improving code organization

## Testing Performed
- Verified battle flow works correctly through several turns
- Confirmed damage calculation and application works properly
- Tested status effect application and processing
- Validated battle log messages appear correctly

## Next Steps
The next cleanup stage will focus on converting status effect-related methods to thin facades that delegate to StatusEffectManager.
