# Changelog Version 0.5.1.2d - 2025-05-04

## Fixed
- **BattleBridge Connectivity Issue**: Resolved critical issue where battle components couldn't find the BattleBridge instance
  - Fixed connection between battle logic and visual components enabling action indicators to work
  - Added reliable global bridge accessor function for consistent bridge access
  - Enhanced BattleBridge initialization with proper error handling
  - Implemented defensive programming to prevent bridge unavailability issues
  - Created a fallback implementation when the real BattleBridge class can't be found

## Added
- **Fallback BattleBridge Implementation**: 
  - Added automatic stub implementation that takes over when the real bridge fails to load
  - Implemented minimal but compatible API to ensure components can always connect
  - Added comprehensive error reporting and diagnostics for bridge loading issues
  - Added dynamic script loading capability to retry loading the real implementation

## Improved
- **Component Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in all components that interact with BattleBridge
  - Added informative console messages for debugging bridge connectivity
  - Implemented graceful fallbacks when bridge is unavailable
  - Fixed cascading failures in battle log, control panel, and scene components
  - Made bridge access more reliable throughout the codebase

## Technical
- Created global `window.getBattleBridge()` accessor function for consistent bridge access
- Enhanced BattleBridgeInit.js with robust initialization and error handling
- Updated BattleBridge.js to properly export its class to the global scope
- Updated DirectBattleLog.js and BattleControlPanel.js to use the accessor function
- Added initialization both at script load and on DOMContentLoaded for redundancy
- Added script loading diagnostics to help troubleshoot library dependencies
- Fixed conflicting bridge implementation with proper class checks
- Fixed script loading order in index.html to ensure proper class initialization

## Implementation Notes
This update completely overhauls how components access the battle bridge:

1. **Robust Class Export**
   - BattleBridge.js now reliably exports itself to window.BattleBridge
   - Added self-check verification to confirm global export succeeded

2. **Resilient Instance Creation**
   - BattleBridgeInit.js creates a global instance at window.battleBridge
   - Fallback implementation kicks in automatically if the real class isn't found
   - Multiple initialization points ensure the instance is always available

3. **Consistent Access Pattern**
   - All components use window.getBattleBridge() to access the bridge
   - This function always returns a valid bridge (either real or fallback)
   - Components no longer need to worry about checking if the bridge exists

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling at all critical points
   - Detailed console messages explain what went wrong
   - Fallback mechanisms prevent catastrophic failures

This fix ensures the action indicators will work properly during battle by guaranteeing that the BattleBridge instance is available and accessible to all components that need it, even when script loading doesn't occur in the ideal order.
