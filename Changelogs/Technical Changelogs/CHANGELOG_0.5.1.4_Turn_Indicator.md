# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 - Enhanced Turn Highlighting

## Overview
This update implements a floor marker indicator that highlights the active character's position during battles. This visual enhancement makes it easier for players to identify which character is currently taking their turn, with team-based color coding and smooth animations.

## Implementation Details

### New Component: TurnIndicator
Created a new component `TurnIndicator.js` in `js/phaser/components/battle/` that:
- Extends `Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics` for efficient rendering
- Creates a circular floor marker with customizable color
- Features smooth fade-in/fade-out animations using Phaser tweens
- Automatically adjusts animation speed based on battle speed settings

### BattleScene.js Modifications
Added the following functionality to BattleScene:
- Added a property to track the active character: `this.activeCharacter`
- Implemented a new `handleTurnStarted` method to process turn events
- Added proper event listener registration for the TURN_STARTED event
- Created logic to position the indicator beneath the active character
- Implemented team-based color coding (blue for player, red for enemy)
- Added proper cleanup routines in the shutdown method

### Key Features
1. **Team-Based Visual Differentiation**:
   - Player characters show a blue floor marker (hex: 0x4488ff)
   - Enemy characters show a red floor marker (hex: 0xff4444)

2. **Speed-Adjusted Animations**:
   - Animation durations automatically adjust based on battle speed setting
   - Base fade duration is 250ms at 1x speed, scaling proportionally with speed changes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error checking for missing characters or containers
   - Fallback handling when sprites cannot be found
   - Graceful degradation if the TurnIndicator component cannot be loaded

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Used ES6 modules with dynamic import for the TurnIndicator component
- Added proper depth positioning to ensure the marker appears below characters
- Implemented event binding with proper context preservation
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the implementation
- Created a clean import-based approach for better code organization

## Testing Guidance
To verify this feature is working correctly:
1. Start a battle with the Phaser UI
2. Observe the floor marker appearing beneath characters as they take turns
3. Verify the marker changes color correctly between player and enemy turns
4. Test with different battle speeds to ensure animations scale properly

## Known Issues
None currently identified for this feature.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements to consider:
- Add pulsing animation to the floor marker for increased visibility
- Consider additional visual effects like particle emissions
- Potentially implement different floor marker shapes for different character roles
