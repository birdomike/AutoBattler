# Version 0.5.1.2f Implementation Details

## Issue Analysis

After implementing the solution for the BattleManager patching issue (Version 0.5.1.2e), two new regressions appeared in the Phaser Battle Scene:

1. **Action Indicators Missing**: The floating text indicators that should display "Auto-Attack", "Ability: ...", or "Status: ..." above characters during combat were no longer appearing.

2. **Health Updates Not Working**: Character health bars were not visually updating when damage was dealt or healing was applied.

Investigation revealed that while the bridge initialization was fixed, our changes broke the event listener setup process:

- Before the fix, event listeners were set up in the fallback path only
- After the fix, the primary and secondary initialization paths had no event listener setup
- This meant that events were being correctly dispatched by BattleManager, but the BattleScene wasn't listening for them

## Solution Approach

The implemented solution addresses these issues by:

1. **Centralizing Event Listener Setup**: Created a new `setupCoreEventListeners()` method to centralize all bridge event listeners in one place.

2. **Ensuring Listeners are Set Up After Bridge Initialization**: Added explicit calls to set up all event listeners after each successful bridge initialization path:
   - Primary path (using `window.initializeBattleBridge()`)
   - Secondary path (using `getBattleBridge()`)
   - Fallback path (direct initialization)
   - On-demand instance creation path

3. **Modularizing the Event Listener Architecture**: Reorganized the event listeners into three distinct methods:
   - `setupHealthUpdateListeners()`: For health bar updates
   - `setupActionIndicatorListeners()`: For action text indicators
   - `setupCoreEventListeners()`: For other essential battle events (turns, floating damage/healing text, battle outcomes)

## Implementation Details

### Added New Method for Core Event Listeners

```javascript
/**
 * Set up core event listeners for battle events
 */
setupCoreEventListeners() {
    if (!this.battleBridge) {
        console.error('BattleScene: Cannot set up core event listeners - BattleBridge not connected');
        return;
    }
    
    // Listen for turn started events
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
        this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
    });

    // Listen for character damaged events for floating text
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_DAMAGED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: ${data.target?.name} damaged by ${data.source?.name || 'effect'} for ${data.amount}`);
        this.showFloatingText(data.target, `-${data.amount}`, { color: '#ff0000' }); // Red for damage
    });

    // Listen for character healed events for floating text
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.CHARACTER_HEALED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: ${data.target?.name} healed by ${data.source?.name || 'effect'} for ${data.amount}`);
        this.showFloatingText(data.target, `+${data.amount}`, { color: '#00ff00' }); // Green for healing
    });

    // Listen for battle ended events
    this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.BATTLE_ENDED, (data) => {
        console.log(`Bridge Event: Battle ended. Result: ${data.winner}`);
        // Show battle outcome screen
        this.showBattleOutcome(data.winner);
    });
    
    console.log('BattleScene: Core event listeners registered');
}
```

### Updated Primary Initialization Path

```javascript
if (success) {
    console.log('BattleScene: Successfully initialized battle bridge');
    // Get the bridge instance after initialization
    this.battleBridge = window.getBattleBridge ? window.getBattleBridge() : window.battleBridge;
    
    // Set up event listeners after successful initialization
    this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
    this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
    
    // Setup other core event listeners
    this.setupCoreEventListeners();
}
```

### Updated Secondary Initialization Path

```javascript
if (this.battleBridge && window.battleManager && typeof this.battleBridge.initialize === 'function') {
    console.log('BattleScene: Initializing battleBridge manually');
    this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
    
    // Set up event listeners after manual initialization
    this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
    this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
    
    // Setup other core event listeners
    this.setupCoreEventListeners();
}
```

### Updated Fallback Path

```javascript
this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this); // Pass references
  
// Set up health update listeners
this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();

// Set up action indicator listeners
this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();

// Set up core event listeners
this.setupCoreEventListeners();
```

### Updated On-Demand Instance Creation

```javascript
this.battleBridge.initialize(window.battleManager, this);
// Set up all event listeners
this.setupHealthUpdateListeners();
this.setupActionIndicatorListeners();
this.setupCoreEventListeners();
```

## Impact & Benefits

1. **Restored Visual Feedback**: Action indicators and health bar updates are now working correctly, providing essential visual feedback during combat.

2. **More Maintainable Code**: Event listener setup is now centralized and modular, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

3. **More Robust Architecture**: All bridge initialization paths now properly set up event listeners, ensuring that the system works regardless of which path is taken.

4. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each type of event listener has its own setup method, improving code organization and readability.

## Testing Notes

The fix should be thoroughly tested to ensure:

1. Action indicators appear above characters when they perform actions
2. Health bars update correctly when characters take damage or receive healing
3. Floating damage/healing numbers appear above characters
4. Turn indicators highlight the active character
5. Battle outcome screen appears at the end of battle

If any of these features still aren't working, further investigation may be needed into the event handling flow.
