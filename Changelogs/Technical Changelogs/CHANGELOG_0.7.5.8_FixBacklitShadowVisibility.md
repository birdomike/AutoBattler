# CHANGELOG 0.7.5.8 - Fix Backlit Shadow Visibility in Turn Indicator

## Overview
This update resolves a critical visibility issue with the newly implemented "backlit shadow" effect for active turn indicators. After the initial implementation in version 0.7.5.7, the shadow was completely invisible despite being properly created and animated. This update corrects the z-order (depth) management and alpha handling to ensure the backlit shadow appears correctly behind the card while extending visibly around its edges.

## Problem Analysis
After implementing the backlit shadow feature, testing revealed several issues preventing the shadow from being visible:

1. **Depth Management Issues**:
   - The `sendToBack()` call in `CardFrameInteractionComponent.showActiveTurnHighlight()` was pushing the shadow too far back in the display list, causing it to be completely hidden behind other opaque elements.
   - The `glowContainer` in `CardFrameManager.js` did not have an explicit depth setting, causing potential z-order conflicts with other card elements.

2. **Alpha Handling Issues**:
   - The shadow was drawn using `fillStyle(color, 0)` which sets the fill alpha to 0, but then the tween was attempting to animate the object's overall alpha. This created a conflict where the fill itself had zero opacity regardless of the object's alpha value.

3. **Visual Layering**:
   - The card's components needed careful depth management to achieve the "backlit" effect where the shadow appears behind the main card frame but extends visibly around its edges.

## Implementation Solution

### 1. Fixed Alpha Handling in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
Modified how the alpha is applied to the shadow graphics object:

```javascript
// Before:
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillStyle(this.config.activeTurn.backlitShadowColor, 0); // Start with alpha 0
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillRoundedRect(
    -shadowWidth / 2,
    -shadowHeight / 2,
    shadowWidth,
    shadowHeight,
    cornerRadius
);

// After:
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillStyle(this.config.activeTurn.backlitShadowColor, 1.0); // Use full opacity for fillStyle
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.fillRoundedRect(
    -shadowWidth / 2,
    -shadowHeight / 2,
    shadowWidth,
    shadowHeight,
    cornerRadius
);

// Set initial alpha to 0 for the fade-in animation
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.setAlpha(0);
```

This separates the fill opacity from the object's overall alpha, allowing the tween to properly animate from transparent to visible.

### 2. Improved Depth Management in CardFrameInteractionComponent.js
Removed the problematic `sendToBack()` call and replaced it with an explicit depth setting:

```javascript
// Before:
// Add to glow container
this.glowContainer.add(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// Send to back to ensure it's behind the card
this.glowContainer.sendToBack(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// After:
// Add to glow container
this.glowContainer.add(this.activeTurnBacklitShadow);

// Set explicit depth to ensure visibility
this.activeTurnBacklitShadow.setDepth(5);
```

### 3. Set Explicit Depth for glowContainer in CardFrameManager.js
Added an explicit depth setting to ensure the glowContainer has the right z-order relative to other card components:

```javascript
// Before:
// Create glowContainer if not found
if (!glowContainer) {
    glowContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, 0);
    this.add(glowContainer);
    this.glowContainer = glowContainer;
    console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer.`);
}

// After:
// Create glowContainer if not found
if (!glowContainer) {
    glowContainer = this.scene.add.container(0, 0);
    this.add(glowContainer);
    this.glowContainer = glowContainer;
    
    // Set depth to ensure the backlit shadow is visible but behind the card frame
    this.glowContainer.setDepth(1);
    console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer and set depth to 1.`);
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Improved console logging to better track the depth settings for debugging:

```javascript
console.log(`CardFrameManager (${this.config.characterName || 'Unknown'}): Created new glowContainer and set depth to 1.`);
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Visible Backlit Effect**: The shadow now appears correctly behind the card while extending visibly around its edges, creating the intended "backlit" visual effect.

2. **Proper Visual Layering**: The depth management ensures that the shadow appears in the right visual layer relative to other card components.

3. **Smooth Animation**: The improved alpha handling allows the shadow to fade in and out smoothly during turn transitions.

4. **Enhanced Debugging**: The improved logging makes it easier to track depth settings and troubleshoot z-order issues.

5. **Better Developer Experience**: The explicit depth settings make the z-order relationships clearer and easier to understand for future development.

## Testing Results

Testing confirms that the backlit shadow is now visible as intended:
- The shadow extends beyond the card's edges, creating a white glow effect
- The shadow fades in smoothly when a character's turn begins
- The shadow fades out smoothly when a character's turn ends
- The shadow appears behind the card frame, creating a true "backlit" effect

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit Depth Management**: When working with layered Phaser elements, it's better to use explicit depth settings rather than relying on add order or methods like `sendToBack()`.

2. **Separate Fill Alpha from Object Alpha**: When working with Phaser Graphics objects, it's important to understand the difference between the fill alpha (set with `fillStyle`) and the object's overall alpha (set with `setAlpha`).

3. **Visual Debugging is Essential**: Visual effects like depth and alpha issues can be hard to diagnose without careful testing and visual debugging.

4. **Layered Architecture Complexity**: In a complex component-based architecture like CardFrame, z-order management needs special attention as it spans multiple components.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Effects that look fine in isolation may not work as expected when integrated into the full system, highlighting the importance of testing in the full context.

## Future Considerations

1. **Depth Constants**: Consider implementing a system of depth constants to make z-order relationships more explicit and consistent across components.

2. **Visual Layer Documentation**: Add documentation about the visual layering system to help future developers understand how different card elements should be positioned in the z-order.

3. **Refine Shadow Appearance**: Now that the shadow is visible, further refinements could be made to its appearance, such as adjusting the size, opacity, or adding a subtle blur effect for a softer glow.
