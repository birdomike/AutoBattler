# Changelog: Version 0.5.1.4 Module Script Type Fix

## Overview
This hotfix addresses a critical browser syntax error that occurred when loading ES modules. The fix properly identifies the ES module scripts in index.html, allowing the browser to parse them correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### ES Module Syntax Error
- Fixed: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" in BattleScene.js
- Fixed: Subsequent "BattleScene class not available" error in TeamBuilderUIUpdates.js

## Implementation Details

### index.html Modifications
- Added `type="module"` attribute to script tags for ES module files:
  - TurnIndicator.js
  - BattleScene.js
- Added proper comments and spacing to clearly identify ES module scripts
- Ensured proper script loading order in the document

## Technical Implementation Notes
- ES module syntax (`import` and `export` statements) can only be used in scripts that are explicitly identified as modules
- Regular script tags load JavaScript as traditional scripts, which don't support module syntax
- Adding `type="module"` instructs the browser to parse the script using ES module rules
- Module scripts automatically use strict mode and have their own scope

## Root Cause Analysis
When we converted BattleScene.js to use ES module syntax (with import/export), we didn't update the corresponding script tag in index.html. This caused the browser to attempt loading it as a regular script, which doesn't support import/export statements, resulting in a syntax error.

By properly identifying the script as a module with `type="module"`, we allow the browser to parse it correctly. This change, combined with our previous fixes to ensure proper ES module exports and global scope assignments, creates a complete solution that supports both modern module-based code and legacy script-based code access patterns.
