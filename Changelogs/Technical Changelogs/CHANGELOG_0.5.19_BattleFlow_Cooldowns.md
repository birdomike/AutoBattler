# CHANGELOG 0.5.19 - Battle Flow Cooldown Fix

## Issue Description
After implementing the BattleFlowController refactoring, battles would start correctly, process the first character's action and display damage in the log, but then completely stall with no further actions occurring. The console showed a critical error:

```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: this.battleManager.reduceCooldowns is not a function
    at BattleFlowController.finishTurn (BattleFlowController.js:656:28)
    at BattleFlowController.executeNextAction (BattleFlowController.js:316:18)
```

This error occurred when the `finishTurn()` method in BattleFlowController attempted to call a non-existent `reduceCooldowns()` method on the BattleManager, preventing the battle from continuing to Turn 2.

## Root Cause Analysis
During the refactoring of BattleManager into smaller components, the responsibility for cooldown reduction was moved to the BattleFlowController. However, the implementation in `finishTurn()` was still delegating this task to BattleManager via a call to `this.battleManager.reduceCooldowns()`, which doesn't exist in the refactored architecture.

The battle would process all actions in Turn 1, but when attempting to finish the turn and move to Turn 2, this error would occur, halting the battle progression.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed Delegation to Non-Existent Method
Removed the line that called the non-existent method:
```javascript
// Removed this line
this.battleManager.reduceCooldowns();
```

### 2. Implemented Direct Cooldown Reduction Logic
Added comprehensive cooldown reduction logic directly within the `finishTurn()` method:

```javascript
// Reduce ability cooldowns for all characters on both teams
console.log('[BattleFlowController] Reducing ability cooldowns at end of turn');

// Process player team cooldowns
this.battleManager.playerTeam.forEach(character => {
    if (character && character.abilities && Array.isArray(character.abilities)) {
        character.abilities.forEach(ability => {
            if (ability && ability.currentCooldown && ability.currentCooldown > 0) {
                ability.currentCooldown--;
                console.log(`[BattleFlowController] Reduced ${character.name}'s ${ability.name} cooldown to ${ability.currentCooldown}`);
            }
        });
    }
});

// Process enemy team cooldowns
this.battleManager.enemyTeam.forEach(character => {
    if (character && character.abilities && Array.isArray(character.abilities)) {
        character.abilities.forEach(ability => {
            if (ability && ability.currentCooldown && ability.currentCooldown > 0) {
                ability.currentCooldown--;
                console.log(`[BattleFlowController] Reduced ${character.name}'s ${ability.name} cooldown to ${ability.currentCooldown}`);
            }
        });
    }
});
```

### 3. Added Defensive Programming Checks
Implemented comprehensive null and type checking to prevent errors:
- Verified that character objects exist before accessing them
- Checked that the abilities property exists and is an array
- Verified each ability has a valid currentCooldown property before decrementing
- Added detailed logging for each cooldown reduction operation

## Results & Benefits
- The battle flow now continues beyond the first turn, allowing battles to complete normally
- Detailed logging provides visibility into the cooldown reduction process
- The robust error handling prevents crashes even with unexpected data formats
- The implementation maintains the same functionality while fixing the critical error

## Lesson Learned: Verify Internal Calls After Refactoring
When moving logic between classes during refactoring (e.g., moving the `finishTurn` logic from `BattleManager` to `BattleFlowController`), it's crucial to verify *all* internal method calls made *within* the moved logic block. The battle stall fixed in this version occurred because the refactored `BattleFlowController.finishTurn` still contained a call to `this.battleManager.reduceCooldowns()`, assuming that method existed on `BattleManager`, when it did not (as the cooldown logic was part of the *original* `BattleManager.finishTurn`). This highlights the need to ensure that either:
1. All necessary sub-logic (like cooldown reduction) is also moved or implemented within the new component.
2. Any required helper methods called on other components are explicitly verified to exist or are created as part of the refactoring.

## Next Steps
Now that battles can progress through multiple turns, we should focus on:
1. Implementing health bar updates by dispatching the necessary damage/healing events from the `applyActionEffect` method
2. Enhancing visual feedback during the battle with status effect indicators and action animations
3. Considering removing the detailed cooldown reduction logs once the system is proven stable
