# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.2.1 - 2025-05-13

## Adjusted Floor Indicator Vertical Position

This update fine-tunes the vertical positioning of the character turn indicator to better align with character art.

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. CharacterSprite.js

**Adjusted the turn indicator positioning value:**

```javascript
// Before
if (this.characterImage && this.characterImage.height) {
    // Position at the bottom of the character with a small offset
    bottomOffset = (this.characterImage.height / 2) + 8;
}

// After
if (this.characterImage && this.characterImage.height) {
    // Position at the bottom of the character with a smaller offset (moved upward)
    bottomOffset = (this.characterImage.height / 2) - 5; // Reduced from +8 to -5 to move upward
}
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Positioning Refinement**:
   - Changed the bottomOffset calculation from adding 8 pixels to subtracting 5 pixels
   - This moves the indicator upward by 13 pixels total
   - The indicator now appears higher relative to character feet, providing better visual alignment

2. **Why This Change**:
   - Previous position placed the indicator too low relative to character art
   - New position creates better visual harmony between characters and their turn indicators
   - Improves the overall polish and aesthetic quality of battle visualization

### Visual Improvements

#### Before:
- Floor indicator appeared too low beneath character feet
- Gap between character and indicator made it feel less connected to the character

#### After:
- Floor indicator is positioned at a more natural height relative to character
- Creates better visual unity between character and their indicator
- Maintains the 3D floor appearance while improving spatial relationship

### Technical Notes

- Adjustment was minimal and focused solely on vertical positioning
- Kept the calculation based on character image height for consistency
- No changes to other aspects of the turn indicator (color, animation, etc.)
- All existing functionality remains intact, only the visual positioning was refined

This update represents a small but meaningful visual improvement to the battle UI that enhances the overall professional quality of the game's presentation.
