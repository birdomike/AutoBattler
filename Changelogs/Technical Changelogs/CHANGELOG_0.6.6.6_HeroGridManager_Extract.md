# CHANGELOG 0.6.6.6 - HeroGridManager Component Extract Phase

## Overview

This update implements Phase 4 of the TeamBuilderUI refactoring plan, focusing on the Extract stage of the Extract-Verify-Remove methodology. We've created a new HeroGridManager component that handles hero grid rendering and selection, continuing the transformation of TeamBuilderUI.js from a monolithic class into a component-based architecture.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created HeroGridManager Component

Created a new component file at `js/ui/teambuilder/HeroGridManager.js` that encapsulates all hero grid-related functionality:

- Rendering the hero grid with filtering support
- Creating hero cards with proper structure and styling
- Handling hero selection and updating selection state
- Managing image loading for character art

The component follows established architecture patterns:
- Clear constructor with parent validation
- Explicit dependencies on parent properties
- Well-defined public interface
- Defensive programming throughout

Key methods include:
- `renderHeroGrid()`: Renders the filtered grid of heroes
- `createHeroCard(hero)`: Creates an individual hero card
- `selectHero(hero)`: Handles hero selection and parent notification
- `updateFilters(filters)`: Updates and applies active filters
- `updateSelectedHero(hero)`: Updates selected hero state

### 2. Enhanced TeamBuilderUI Integration

Modified TeamBuilderUI.js to:

- Initialize the HeroGridManager component
- Delegate hero grid rendering to the component when available
- Maintain original implementation for fallback
- Add proper callback for hero selection
- Update filter handling to work with the component

The delegation pattern follows the same approach used for previous components:

```javascript
renderHeroGrid() {
    if (this.heroGridManager) {
        this.heroGridManager.renderHeroGrid();
        return;
    }
    
    // Original implementation follows for fallback
    ...
}
```

### 3. Added Hero Selection Callback

Implemented `onHeroSelected(hero)` callback in TeamBuilderUI to handle hero selection events from the component:

```javascript
onHeroSelected(hero) {
    this.selectHeroDetails(hero);
}
```

### 4. Updated FilterManager Integration

Enhanced the filter change handling to work with the component:

```javascript
onFiltersChanged(filters) {
    // Update local filters reference
    this.activeFilters = filters;
    
    // Update the hero grid based on new filters
    if (this.heroGridManager) {
        this.heroGridManager.updateFilters(filters);
    } else {
        this.renderHeroGrid();
    }
}
```

### 5. Updated Script Loading

Updated index.html to load HeroGridManager.js before TeamBuilderUI.js:

```html
<script src="js/ui/teambuilder/TeamBuilderUtils.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/ui/teambuilder/HeroDetailPanelManager.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/ui/teambuilder/FilterManager.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/ui/teambuilder/HeroGridManager.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/ui/TeamBuilderUI.js" defer></script>
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: The HeroGridManager component further reduces the responsibility of TeamBuilderUI.js, focusing it on orchestration rather than implementation details.

2. **Improved Maintainability**: Hero grid-related functionality is now contained in a single file, making it easier to update or debug.

3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the UI, adhering to the single responsibility principle.

4. **Consistent Architecture**: The implementation follows the same patterns established in previous refactoring phases.

## Component Architecture

The HeroGridManager follows the established component architecture:

1. **Constructor with Parent Validation**:
```javascript
constructor(parentUI) {
    // Validate parent
    if (!parentUI) {
        console.error("[HeroGridManager] parentUI is required");
        return;
    }
    
    this.parentUI = parentUI;
    
    // Required references from parent
    this.availableHeroes = parentUI.availableHeroes;
    this.typeColors = parentUI.typeColors;
    this.selectedHeroDetails = null;
    this.imageLoader = parentUI.imageLoader;
    
    // Component-specific properties
    this.activeFilters = {
        types: [],
        roles: []
    };
    
    console.log("[HeroGridManager] Initialized");
}
```

2. **Well-Defined Public Interface**:
```javascript
// Public methods
renderHeroGrid()
selectHero(hero)
updateFilters(filters)
updateSelectedHero(hero)
triggerImageLoader()
```

3. **Dependency Management**:
The component explicitly requires references to:
- `availableHeroes`: The list of available heroes
- `typeColors`: Color definitions for hero types
- `imageLoader`: Reference to the image loading system

4. **Error Handling and Defensive Programming**:
```javascript
renderHeroGrid() {
    const heroesGrid = document.getElementById('heroes-grid');
    if (!heroesGrid) {
        console.error("[HeroGridManager] Heroes grid element not found");
        return;
    }
    
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

## Integration with Existing Components

HeroGridManager integrates with:

1. **FilterManager** (indirectly):
   - Receives filter state via TeamBuilderUI and the `updateFilters` method
   - Applies filters to render the appropriate heroes

2. **TeamBuilderUtils**:
   - Uses shared utility functions like `splitTypes` and `renderMultiTypeSpans`
   - Maintains consistent rendering patterns across components

3. **ImageLoader**:
   - Triggers the image loader to check for new images after rendering
   - Maintains the same art loading patterns as the original implementation

## Testing Considerations

This implementation maintains backward compatibility through:

1. **Feature Detection**: Checks if HeroGridManager exists before using it
2. **Fallback Implementation**: Retains original code path if component initialization fails
3. **Method Verification**: Validates required methods exist before delegating

## Next Steps

The Extract phase is now complete. The next phases will be:

1. **Verify Phase**: Run and test the implementation to ensure it works correctly, focusing on:
   - Hero grid rendering
   - Filtering functionality
   - Hero selection
   - Art loading
   - Integration with other components

2. **Remove Phase**: After successful verification, remove the original implementation from TeamBuilderUI.js, replacing it with a minimal fallback for error handling.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Dependencies**: The hero grid interacts with multiple systems (filtering, image loading, hero selection), requiring careful management of dependencies.

2. **Event Flow Management**: The bi-directional communication between components (filters → grid, grid → hero details) highlights the importance of clear event flow patterns.

3. **Interface Design**: Designing a clean interface that encapsulates all necessary functionality while maintaining flexibility is crucial for component-based architecture.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: The Extract-Verify-Remove methodology continues to prove effective, allowing for safe, incremental improvements to the codebase.

This update represents another significant step toward the fully component-based architecture outlined in the TeamBuilderUI refactoring plan, with four of six planned components now implemented.
