# CHANGELOG 0.7.0.6 - CardFrame Focused Debugging Implementation

## Purpose
Implement a comprehensive debugging approach to isolate and identify the exact cause of character sprites not appearing in CardFrame components.

## Changes Made
- Completely rewrote the `createCharacterSprite()` method in CardFrame.js with a focused, step-by-step debugging approach
- Implemented seven discrete debugging stages with detailed logging at each step:
  1. Texture validation
  2. Texture dimensions and frame data verification
  3. Sprite creation with minimal configuration
  4. Forced visibility settings (alpha, scale, tint)
  5. Sprite dimensions verification
  6. Container hierarchy inspection
  7. Container addition without masking

## Technical Details
- Created sprite at center position (0,0) to eliminate positioning issues
- Applied extreme visibility settings:
  - Doubled scale (2.0)
  - Bright red tint (0xFF0000)
  - Maximum alpha (1.0)
  - Explicit visibility (true)
- Set extremely high depth value (1000) to ensure z-order priority
- Deliberately skipped mask application to eliminate masking as a potential cause
- Added detailed logging of container hierarchy and dimensions
- Disabled fallback creation to prevent interference with debugging
- Added comprehensive frame data inspection to verify texture integrity

## Expected Outcomes
This diagnostic version should:
1. Produce a large, bright red character sprite at the center of each card
2. Generate extensive console logs showing exactly what's happening during sprite creation
3. Provide clear data about texture existence, dimensions, and frame structures
4. Eliminate masking and positioning as potential issues

## Diagnosis Process
The console logs produced by this version should be analyzed to determine:
1. If textures are being properly located and loaded
2. If sprites have valid dimensions or are being created as zero-width objects
3. If container hierarchy or visibility settings are interfering with rendering
4. Whether sprites are actually being created and added to the container

These insights will guide the next step in resolving the sprite visibility issue.
