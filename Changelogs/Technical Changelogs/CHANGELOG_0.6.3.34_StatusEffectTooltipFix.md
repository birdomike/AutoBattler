# CHANGELOG 0.6.3.34 - StatusEffectTooltip Error Fix

## Issue Description

The game was experiencing an intermittent runtime error in the Phaser UI: 
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cut')
```

The error originated within Phaser's text rendering system but was triggered by our StatusEffectTooltip component when attempting to set text on potentially null text objects. This occurred most frequently during:
- Rapid mouse movements over status effect icons
- Scene transitions or changes that invalidated Phaser text objects
- Status effect application/removal while tooltips were being shown/hidden

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Null Checks**: The `clearContent()` and `createTooltipContent()` methods were directly operating on Phaser text objects without validating their existence first.

2. **Singleton Pattern Concerns**: As a singleton, the StatusEffectTooltip persisted across operations, but its internal references to scene-specific objects became invalid in certain scenarios.

3. **Invalid Text Objects**: When Phaser tried to access properties (like 'cut' in the minified code) on null text objects, the error occurred.

4. **Scene Transition Vulnerability**: The component had no validation to ensure the scene was still active before attempting operations.

## Technical Solution

### 1. Scene Validity Check in showTooltip()

Added a check at the beginning of the method to verify the scene is valid and active:

```javascript
showTooltip(statusId, definition, position, duration, stacks) {
    // Check if scene is still valid
    if (!this.scene || !this.scene.sys || !this.scene.sys.isActive()) {
        console.warn('[StatusEffectTooltip] Cannot show tooltip, scene is invalid or inactive.');
        return;
    }
    // Rest of method...
}
```

### 2. Robust Null Checks in clearContent()

Added null checks for all object references before attempting operations:

```javascript
clearContent() {
    if (this.titleText) {
        this.titleText.setText('');
    }
    if (this.descText) {
        this.descText.setText('');
    }
    if (this.infoText) {
        this.infoText.setText('');
    }
    if (this.graphics) {
        this.graphics.clear();
    }
}
```

### 3. Defensive Programming in createTooltipContent()

Added comprehensive null checks and fallbacks throughout the method:

```javascript
// Before: this.titleText.setText(formattedTitle);
// After:
if (this.titleText) {
    this.titleText.setText(formattedTitle);
} else {
    console.warn(`[StatusEffectTooltip] Attempted to set text on a null titleText object for statusId: ${title}`);
}
```

Similar checks were added for all text objects and graphics operations.

### 4. Enhanced Lifecycle Management in destroy()

Explicitly nullified references to prevent operations on stale objects:

```javascript
destroy() {
    if (this.currentTween) {
        this.scene.tweens.remove(this.currentTween);
        this.currentTween = null;
    }
    
    if (this.container) {
        this.container.destroy();
        this.container = null;
    }
    
    // Explicitly null out references to child objects
    this.titleText = null;
    this.descText = null;
    this.infoText = null;
    this.graphics = null;
    
    // Remove singleton reference
    if (window.statusEffectTooltip === this) {
        window.statusEffectTooltip = null;
    }
}
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Error Prevention**: The code now gracefully handles cases where text objects become null or invalid.

2. **Improved Stability**: Players will no longer encounter the disruptive "Cannot read properties of null" error.

3. **Better Error Diagnostics**: The code now logs specific warnings when it encounters null objects, making debugging easier.

4. **Scene Awareness**: The tooltip now verifies scene validity before attempting operations.

5. **Cleaner Resource Management**: Explicit nullification in destroy() prevents stale references.

## Testing

Testing should focus on scenarios that previously triggered the error:

1. Rapidly moving the mouse over multiple status icons
2. Performing battle actions while hovering over status icons
3. Status effect applications during tooltip display

## Lessons Learned

1. **Defensive Programming is Critical in UI**: User interactions can create unpredictable timing issues, making defensive null checks essential.

2. **Singletons Require Special Care**: When using the singleton pattern, extra attention must be paid to object lifecycle and scene transitions.

3. **Minification Complicates Debugging**: The error referenced 'cut', a minified property name in Phaser, highlighting how minification can obscure the actual issue.

4. **Expect the Unexpected**: Even carefully designed components need to handle edge cases like rapidly triggered events or scene transitions.

5. **Error Logs Provide Clues**: The stack trace revealing StatusEffectTooltip.clearContent was crucial in identifying the source of the issue.

## Future Improvements

Later enhancements could include:

1. A proactive tooltip recreation system that detects and rebuilds missing text objects
2. A formal scene transition handling mechanism for the singleton pattern
3. Event debouncing to prevent rapid tooltip show/hide cycles
4. A more robust approach to singleton management across different scenes
