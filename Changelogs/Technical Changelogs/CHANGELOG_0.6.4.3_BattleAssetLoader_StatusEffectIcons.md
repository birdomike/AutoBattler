# CHANGELOG 0.6.4.3 - BattleAssetLoader Status Effect Icons Integration

## Overview

This update implements Stage 3 (Extract phase) of the BattleAssetLoader refactoring plan. It adds status effect icon loading functionality to the BattleAssetLoader component while maintaining backward compatibility with the original methods in BattleScene.js. This follows the Extract-Verify-Remove pattern outlined in the refactoring plan, with this update representing the "Extract" step.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Status Effect Icon Loading to BattleAssetLoader

Added two new methods to BattleAssetLoader.js:

- **loadStatusEffectIcons()**: Loads status effect icons with appropriate error handling
  - Gets the mapping from initStatusIconMapping()
  - Loads each icon using the scene's loader
  - Returns the mapping for BattleScene to use
  - Includes comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

- **initStatusIconMapping()**: Initializes the status icon mapping
  - Uses window.StatusIconMapper when available
  - Provides a complete fallback mapping when StatusIconMapper isn't available
  - Returns the mapping instead of setting it on the instance
  - Includes robust error handling

Key improvements over the original implementation:
- Better error handling with clear fallback strategies
- Explicit return values to provide mapping data to the caller
- More detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Consistent code style with the existing methods

### 2. Updated BattleScene.js to Use BattleAssetLoader

Modified the preload method to use the new BattleAssetLoader functionality:

```javascript
// Add status effect icon loading through the asset loader
this.statusIconMapping = this.assetLoader.loadStatusEffectIcons();

// If status icon mapping wasn't returned properly, fall back to original method
if (!this.statusIconMapping || Object.keys(this.statusIconMapping).length === 0) {
    console.warn("[BattleScene] Status icon mapping not returned from asset loader, using original methods");
    this.preloadStatusEffectIcons();
    this.statusIconMapping = this.initStatusIconMapping();
}
```

This change:
- Uses the BattleAssetLoader for status effect icon loading
- Verifies that the mapping was returned successfully
- Falls back to the original methods if needed
- Maintains backward compatibility during this transitional phase

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Status effect icon loading is now handled by the dedicated BattleAssetLoader component.

2. **Better Error Handling**: The implementation includes comprehensive error handling with appropriate fallbacks.

3. **Reduced Coupling**: BattleScene.js no longer contains the details of status effect icon loading.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allows for safe transition without breaking existing functionality.

## Testing Verification

Testing should verify:

1. Status effect icons load correctly through BattleAssetLoader
2. Tooltips display with proper icons and information
3. The fallback mechanism works if the BattleAssetLoader fails
4. No errors appear in the console related to status effect icons

## Future Work

This change is part of the ongoing BattleScene refactoring plan:

- Version 0.6.4.3 (Current): Extract status effect icon loading into BattleAssetLoader
- Version 0.6.4.4 (Next): Remove original status effect icon loading methods from BattleScene
- Future versions: Complete Stage 4 to provide a unified asset loading interface

## Lessons Learned

1. **Return Values vs. Properties**: Using return values from methods is often clearer than setting properties on the instance, especially when there might be multiple callers.

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Including proper error handling in each refactored component ensures the system degrades gracefully when issues occur.

3. **Testing Fallbacks**: Ensuring fallback mechanisms work properly is as important as testing the primary code path.

4. **Incremental Approach Benefits**: The Extract-Verify-Remove pattern allows for safer refactoring by maintaining backward compatibility at each step.
