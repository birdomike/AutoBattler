CHANGELOG 0.7.6.7 - Auto-Attack Sound System Phase 1 Completion
Fixed

Audio Context Suspension During Delayed Sounds

Issue: Melee attack sounds (500ms delayed) failed because audio context suspended between initial sound and delayed playback
Solution: Added automatic audio context resumption in SoundEventHandler.scheduleDelayedSound()
Implementation:
javascript// CRITICAL FIX: Resume audio context if suspended before playing delayed sound
if (this.soundManager.scene.sound.context && 
    this.soundManager.scene.sound.context.state === 'suspended') {
    console.log(`[SoundEventHandler] âš¡ Resuming suspended audio context for delayed ${event} sound (${character.name})`);
    await this.soundManager.scene.sound.context.resume();
}



Default Ranged Sound Configuration

Issue: defaults.autoAttack.ranged.release.path pointed to directory instead of file
Solution: Changed from 'defaults/auto_attacks/ranged_release/' to 'defaults/auto_attacks/ranged_release/Bow Attack 1.wav'
File: AudioAssetMappings.js


Zephyr Character Sound Mapping

Issue: Zephyr had no sound profile (null), causing fallback to problematic defaults
Solution: Added Zephyr to 'genre_specific/sword_melee_genre' in AbilityAnimationConfig.js
Result: Zephyr now uses robust sword sounds like other melee fighters



Enhanced

Audio Context State Monitoring

Added real-time audio context state change listeners
Enhanced debug logging for audio context transitions
Warning messages when context becomes suspended


Delayed Sound Error Handling

Comprehensive try-catch blocks around delayed sound playback
Graceful cleanup of timeout references even when errors occur
Better error messages with character context


Sound Resolution Debugging

Enhanced logging shows exact resolution path for each character
4-tier resolution results displayed with variation information
Clear success/failure indicators for each sound attempt



Technical Architecture

4-Tier Resolution System (fully functional):

Tier 1: Ability-specific sounds (future implementation)
Tier 2: Character-specific sounds (Sylvanna unique bow sounds)
Tier 3: Genre-specific sounds (sword fighters, frost casters)
Tier 4: Default fallback sounds (basic melee/ranged sounds)


Timing System (operational):

Ranged attacks: Immediate sound on action start
Melee attacks: 500ms delayed sound for animation synchronization
Audio context protection: Automatic resumption for delayed playback


Caching System (optimized):

Sound objects cached after first load
Prevents redundant file loading
Shared sounds across similar characters reduce memory usage



Current Character Sound Assignments

Drakarion, Caste, Vaelgor, Zephyr: Sword melee sounds
Aqualia, Nyria: Frost caster sounds (ice throwing)
Sylvanna: Unique bow sounds
Lumina: Default ranged sounds (fallback system)

Performance Improvements

Eliminated audio context suspension cascade failures
Reduced memory usage through sound caching
Optimized event flow with defensive programming
