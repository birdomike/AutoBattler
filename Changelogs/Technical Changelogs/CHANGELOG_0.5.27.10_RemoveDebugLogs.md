# CHANGELOG 0.5.27.10 - Remove Debug Logging

## Overview
This update removes temporary debug logging statements that were added during previous fixes but are no longer needed. The debug logs were producing verbose output in the console during normal gameplay, particularly related to character validation and target selection.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Unnecessary Debug Output**: Several debug logging statements marked with "TEMPORARY DEBUG (v0.5.27.2)" were producing verbose output during normal gameplay.
2. **Performance Impact**: The debug logging included JSON.stringify operations on large character objects, which can impact performance.
3. **Console Clutter**: The logs made it harder to spot actual warnings and errors in the console.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. ActionGenerator.js Changes
Removed all temporary debug logs from the ActionGenerator component:

1. Removed target validation debug logs:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   console.log(`[DEBUG 0.5.27.2] Target for Validation in ActionGenerator (Targeting: ${target.name || 'NO_NAME'}):`, JSON.stringify(target));
   ```

2. Removed multi-target validation debug logs:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   console.log(`[DEBUG 0.5.27.2] Multi-Target Validation #${i} (Targeting: ${individualTarget?.name || 'NO_NAME'}):`, 
      individualTarget ? JSON.stringify(individualTarget) : 'null');
   ```

3. Removed damage calculation debug logs:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   console.log(`[DEBUG ActionGenerator - calculateDamageForAction] Received Actor: ${attacker?.name || 'undefined'}, Target: ${typeof target === 'object' && target !== null && target.name ? target.name : JSON.stringify(target)}, Ability: ${ability?.name || 'auto-attack'}`);
   ```

4. Removed multi-target ability debug logs:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   console.log(`[DEBUG 0.5.27.2] Calculating damage for target #${i}: ${individualTarget.name}`);
   console.log(`[DEBUG 0.5.27.2] Created multi-target action with ${multiTargetDamageResults.length} targets`);
   ```

### 2. BattleManager.js Changes
Removed character state debug logs from the generateTurnActions method:

```javascript
// REMOVED:
console.log(`[DEBUG 0.5.27.2] Character for ActionGenerator (Player: ${character.name || 'NO_NAME'}):`,
    `HP: ${character.currentHp}/${character.stats?.hp},`,
    `Status Effects: ${character.statusEffects?.length || 0},`,
    `Abilities: ${character.abilities?.length || 0}`);
```

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console Output**: The console will now show only relevant warnings and errors, making it easier to spot actual issues.
2. **Improved Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary JSON.stringify operations on large objects during normal gameplay.
3. **Reduced Noise**: Players and developers will no longer see technical debug messages during normal gameplay.
4. **Code Maintainability**: Removes temporary debugging code that was only needed for a specific version's hotfixes.

## Technical Notes

The debug logs being removed were introduced in version 0.5.27.2 and its hotfixes to diagnose specific issues with character validation and multi-target abilities. These issues have been resolved, and the debug logging is no longer necessary.

All functional error and warning logging remains intact to ensure that actual problems are still properly reported. Only temporary debugging statements have been removed.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start a battle with multiple characters
2. Check the console for any remaining debug logs with the pattern "[DEBUG 0.5.27.2]"
3. Verify that normal gameplay proceeds without errors
4. Ensure that actual warnings and errors (like "No target found" warnings) still appear in the console when appropriate
