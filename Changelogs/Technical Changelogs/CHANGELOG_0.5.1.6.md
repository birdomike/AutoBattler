# Detailed Technical Changelog for Version 0.5.1.6 - 2025-05-07

## Issue Resolution: Turn Indicator Floor Marker Not Displaying

This update fixes a critical issue where the turn indicator floor marker wasn't appearing beneath characters during battle due to a method name mismatch in the BattleBridge patching system.

### Root Cause Analysis

The investigation of diagnostic logs added in v0.5.1.5 revealed that while BattleManager was attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED events:
- The log `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...` was appearing in the console
- No logs from BattleBridge's patched method or BattleScene.handleTurnStarted were appearing

The root cause was identified as a **method name mismatch** in BattleBridge.js:
1. BattleBridge was trying to patch a method called `startTurn`
2. However, BattleManager actually uses a method called `startNextTurn` to start new turns
3. This mismatch meant the patch wasn't being applied, so TURN_STARTED events were never dispatched

### Modified Files and Specific Changes

#### 1. BattleBridge.js
**Change 1**: Updated method reference in stored original methods

```javascript
// Before
const originalStartTurn = this.battleManager.startTurn;

// After
const originalStartNextTurn = this.battleManager.startNextTurn;  // UPDATED: correct method name
```

**Change 2**: Updated the method patching to target startNextTurn instead of startTurn

```javascript
// Before
// Patch startTurn
if (originalStartTurn) {
    this.battleManager.startTurn = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: startTurn patched method called');
        const result = originalStartTurn.apply(this, arguments);
        const currentChar = this.currentCharacter || {};
        console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar.name);
        console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.');
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
            currentCharacter: this.currentCharacter,
            turnNumber: this.turnNumber
        });
        return result;
    };
}

// After
// Patch startNextTurn
if (originalStartNextTurn) {
    this.battleManager.startNextTurn = function() {
        console.log('BattleBridge: startNextTurn patched method called');
        const result = originalStartNextTurn.apply(this, arguments);
        // Get the active character (often the first character in the action queue)
        const currentChar = this.actionQueue && this.actionQueue.length > 0 ? 
                            this.actionQueue[0]?.actor : null;
        console.log('BattleBridge: Current character for turn:', currentChar?.name || 'Unknown');
        console.log('[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.');
        self.dispatchEvent(self.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, {
            character: currentChar,  // Use 'character' as the property name for consistency
            currentCharacter: currentChar,  // Keep 'currentCharacter' for backward compatibility
            turnNumber: this.currentTurn
        });
        return result;
    };
}
```

**Key improvements in the patch:**
1. Uses the correct method name `startNextTurn`
2. Extracts the active character from the `actionQueue` which is more reliable
3. Includes both `character` and `currentCharacter` in the event data for backward compatibility
4. Uses `this.currentTurn` instead of `this.turnNumber` for the correct property name
5. Added proper null checking for robustness

#### 2. BattleScene.js
**Change**: Updated event listener to use proper method binding instead of an anonymous function

```javascript
// Before
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, (data) => {
    console.log(`Bridge Event: Turn ${data.turnNumber} started. Character: ${data.currentCharacter?.name}`);
    console.log('[BattleScene] TURN_STARTED listener setup complete.');
    this.highlightActiveCharacter(data.currentCharacter);
});

// After
this.battleBridge.addEventListener(this.battleBridge.eventTypes.TURN_STARTED, this.handleTurnStarted.bind(this));
```

**Improvement**: Using `bind` ensures the `handleTurnStarted` method is called with the correct `this` context, properly leveraging the existing detailed implementation.

### Expected Behavior After Fix

With these changes, the turn indicator floor marker should now appear correctly:

1. When a turn starts, BattleManager calls `startNextTurn()`
2. The patched version of `startNextTurn()` dispatches the TURN_STARTED event
3. BattleScene receives the event and calls `handleTurnStarted()`
4. The `handleTurnStarted()` method extracts the character data and calls `this.turnIndicator.showAt()`
5. The turn indicator appears underneath the active character

### Testing Steps

1. Start a battle in the Phaser UI
2. Verify that the turn indicator (circle) appears beneath each character when their turn starts
3. Check that the indicator color matches the team color (blue for player, red for enemy)
4. Confirm that the indicator fades in/out smoothly when turns change
5. Verify the console log shows the complete diagnostic chain:
   - `[BattleManager] Attempting to dispatch TURN_STARTED event...`
   - `BattleBridge: startNextTurn patched method called`
   - `[BattleBridge Patch] Preparing to dispatch TURN_STARTED event.`
   - `[BattleScene] handleTurnStarted CALLED. Data: {...}`

### Implementation Lessons

This issue highlights several important principles:
1. **Name consistency**: Method names should be consistent across inter-component references
2. **Compatibility**: When working with events, include backward-compatible property names
3. **Error resilience**: Add null checking and use optional chaining (`?.`) for potentially missing values
4. **Unified interfaces**: Components should respond to both direct calls and event-based interactions
5. **Diagnostic logging**: Strategic logging helps pinpoint issues in complex event flows
