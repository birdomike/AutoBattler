# Technical Changelog: Version 0.6.3.11 - Action Event Diagnostics

## Overview

This update adds enhanced diagnostic logging to trace the flow of action objects from creation in ActionGenerator through BattleBridge to BattleEventManager. The goal is to identify why the Action Indicator text and Battle Log declarations aren't showing abilities correctly despite the action objects being created with the correct properties.

## Files Changed

1. `js/phaser/bridge/BattleBridge.js`
2. `js/battle_logic/abilities/ActionGenerator.js`

## Detailed Changes

### 1. BattleBridge.js - Enhanced Event Data Logging and Consistency

Added explicit logging of the event data being dispatched in the patched `applyActionEffect` method:

```javascript
// Added detailed logging of the exact event data payload
console.log('[BattleBridge.applyActionEffect Patch] Action object JUST BEFORE dispatching CHARACTER_ACTION:', 
    JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(eventData.action)));
```

Added `actionType` property to ensure consistency with both property naming patterns:

```javascript
// Added actionType property alongside type for consistency
action: {
    type: action.actionType,
    actionType: action.actionType, // ADDED: Duplicate type as actionType
    name: action.abilityName || action.actionType,
    abilityName: action.abilityName,
    target: action.target
}
```

### 2. ActionGenerator.js - Full Action Object Logging

Added complete action object logging to capture the exact structure of the object being returned:

```javascript
// Added full action object logging using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) to avoid circular references
console.log(`[ActionGenerator.generateCharacterAction] FULL ACTION OBJECT:`, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(action)));
```

## Technical Analysis

The focus of these changes is to diagnose a potential data integrity issue where:

1. ActionGenerator creates an action object with `actionType='ability'` and `abilityName='Flame Strike'`
2. BattleEventManager receives an action object with `actionType=undefined` and `abilityName='Auto Attack'`

The strategic logging added in this update will allow us to see:
- The exact action object structure when it leaves ActionGenerator
- The exact event data payload when it's about to be dispatched by BattleBridge
- Any differences between the two points that could explain the discrepancy

By explicitly adding both `type` and `actionType` properties to the event data in BattleBridge, we're ensuring the receiving code has access to the action type regardless of which property name it's checking for.

## Next Steps

After collecting logs from these changes, we can:
1. Identify exactly where and how the action data is being transformed
2. Apply targeted fixes to ensure data integrity throughout the event flow
3. Verify that both the Action Indicator and Battle Log display abilities correctly
