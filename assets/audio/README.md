# Audio Files

This directory will contain sound effects for the game. Currently, the SoundManager uses console.log statements instead of actual audio playback, since the sound files haven't been created yet.

## Sound Files Needed:
- click.mp3 - UI button click sound
- hover.mp3 - Sound when hovering over UI elements
- select.mp3 - When selecting a hero
- add.mp3 - When adding a hero to the team
- remove.mp3 - When removing a hero from the team
- error.mp3 - Error sound for invalid actions
- battle_start.mp3 - When starting a battle

These will be implemented in later phases when we focus on audio integration.
