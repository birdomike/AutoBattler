\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b\f0\fs22\lang9 Phaser Combat Enhancement Roadmap\par
\b0 Overview\par
This roadmap outlines how to implement features from our DOM version into the Phaser version of our AutoBattler game. Phaser offers significant advantages for game-specific rendering, animation, and performance compared to DOM manipulation, but requires different implementation approaches.\par

Key Considerations for Phaser vs DOM:\par
Performance Optimization:\par
Phaser uses WebGL rendering which is more efficient than DOM manipulation\par
Use object pooling for frequently created objects (floating text, particles)\par
Consider texture atlases for multiple small images\par
Component Architecture:\par
Create reusable components that extend Phaser game objects\par
Maintain clear separation between visual components and game logic\par
Use BattleBridge for communication between core game and visuals\par
\par
Event-Based Communication:\par
\par
Continue using the event system for communication between BattleManager and Phaser\par
Add new event types as needed for enhanced visual feedback\par
Ensure events include all necessary data for visual representation\par
\par
Implementation Order (Suggestion):\par
Start with core gameplay visualization (Features 1, 2, 11)\par
Then implement UI enhancements (Features 3, 6, 7)\par
Follow with special effects (Features 4, 8, 9)\par
Finish with complex UI systems (Features 5, 10, 12)\par
