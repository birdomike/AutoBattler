# Phase 0 Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Characters.json Modification
- Added `autoAttackType` property to all 8 characters
- **Melee**: Caste (Berserker), Drakarion (Warrior), Vaelgor (Sentinel), Zephyr (Assassin)
- **Ranged**: Nyria (Elementalist), Aqualia (Mage), Sylvanna (Ranger), Lumina (Cleric)
- No other character data was modified

### 2. ✅ Core Configuration Files Created
- **`js/data/AbilityAnimationConfig.js`** - Single source of truth for presentation layer
  - Auto-attack configurations (melee vs ranged)
  - Explicit ability configs (drakarion_flame_strike, aqualia_tidal_wave, lumina_divine_protection)
  - Character sound profiles mapping
  - Smart inference system for unmapped abilities
  
- **`js/data/AudioAssetMappings.js`** - Hierarchical sound resolution system
  - Three-tier resolution: ability-specific → character-specific → defaults
  - Character sound profiles (sword_warrior, nature_ranger, fire_mage, etc.)
  - Helper methods with error handling and testing system

### 3. ✅ Asset Directory Structure Established
- **Projectile Images**: `assets/images/projectiles/` with organized subdirectories
- **Sound Organization**: `assets/audio/InCombat_Sounds/` with hierarchical structure
- Placeholder documentation for all required assets

### 4. ✅ Existing Sound Files Available
Discovered existing sound collection:
- 17 slap sounds (slap 1-17.wav) → suitable for melee impacts
- 18 woosh sounds (woosh 1-25.wav) → suitable for ranged attacks/movement
- Various splash sounds → suitable for water abilities

## Current Status
- ✅ Game loads and runs without errors
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Foundation ready for Phase 1 implementation
- ✅ Clean separation: game mechanics vs presentation layer maintained

## Next Steps for Phase 1
1. **Integrate sound system** with BattleEventManager
2. **Implement auto-attack sound triggering** using existing slap/woosh files
3. **Create basic animation enhancements** for melee vs ranged attacks
4. **Test sound resolution system** with actual audio playback

## Configuration Highlights

### Character Sound Profile Mapping
```json
{
  "drakarion": "sword_warrior",    // Will use sword attack sounds when available
  "caste": "sword_warrior",        // Will use sword attack sounds when available  
  "vaelgor": "sword_warrior",      // Will use sword attack sounds when available
  "sylvanna": "nature_ranger",     // Will use bow/nature sounds when available
  "aqualia": "fire_mage",          // Will use magical sounds when available
  "nyria": "storm_mage",           // Will use storm/lightning sounds when available
  "zephyr": "wind_assassin",       // Will use wind/melee sounds when available
  "lumina": null                   // Uses defaults
}
```

### Auto-Attack Type Assignments
- **Melee Auto-Attacks**: Move to target → strike → return (Warriors, Berserkers, etc.)
- **Ranged Auto-Attacks**: Prepare → release projectile → impact (Mages, Rangers, etc.)

### Smart Inference Examples
- `drakarion_flame_strike` → inferred as fire/projectile (from damageType + targetType)
- `aqualia_tidal_wave` → inferred as water/aoe (from damageType + targetType)  
- `lumina_divine_protection` → inferred as light/instant (from damageType + targetType)

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified:
- `data/characters.json` (added autoAttackType only)

### Created:
- `js/data/AbilityAnimationConfig.js`
- `js/data/AudioAssetMappings.js`  
- `assets/images/projectiles/` directory structure
- `assets/audio/InCombat_Sounds/` organized structure
- Placeholder files and documentation

### Available Assets:
- 17 slap sounds for melee impacts
- 25 woosh sounds for ranged attacks
- Various splash sounds for water abilities
- Existing sound files can be mapped to new structure

## Validation Results
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Game loads normally
- ✅ Team Builder functions correctly
- ✅ Battles run without issues
- ✅ Configuration files import successfully
- ✅ Sound directory structure established

**Phase 0 is COMPLETE and ready for Phase 1 implementation!**
