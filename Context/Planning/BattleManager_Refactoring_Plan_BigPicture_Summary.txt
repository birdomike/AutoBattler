# BattleManager Refactoring Plan - Summary

## Overview
Modular refactoring of monolithic BattleManager.js into specialized components using a "Clean As You Go" approach with feature toggles for continuous functionality.

## Directory Structure (High-Level)
```
js/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ battle_logic/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/        - Core battle controller classes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status/      - Status effect management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ damage/      - Damage calculation and healing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abilities/   - Ability processing and targeting
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ passives/    - Passive ability triggers and tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ events/      - Event dispatching and battle logging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug/ (PLANNED)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DebugManager.js and domain-specific debuggers
```

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Setup and Infrastructure ‚úì COMPLETED
- Create directory structure and shell files
- Add toggle mechanism to BattleManager
- CHECKPOINT: Test with toggle disabled
- CLEANUP: Remove duplicate initialization code

### Stage 2: Status Effect System ‚úì COMPLETED
- Implement StatusEffectManager and StatusEffectDefinitionLoader
- CHECKPOINT: Test status effects with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original status effect code

### Stage 3: Battle Flow Control ‚úì COMPLETED
- Implement BattleFlowController with turn management
- CHECKPOINT: Test battle sequence with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original flow control code

### Stage 4: Damage and Healing System ‚úì COMPLETED
- Implement DamageCalculator, HealingProcessor, TypeEffectivenessCalculator
- CHECKPOINT: Test damage calculations with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original damage and healing code

### Stage 5: Ability Processing üîÑ About to Start
- Implement AbilityProcessor, TargetingSystem, ActionGenerator
- CHECKPOINT: Test ability execution with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original ability processing code

### Stage 6: Passive Ability System ‚è≥ PLANNED
- Implement PassiveAbilityManager and PassiveTriggerTracker
- CHECKPOINT: Test passive triggers with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original passive code

### Stage 7: Events and Logging ‚è≥ PLANNED
- Implement BattleEventDispatcher and BattleLogManager
- CHECKPOINT: Test complete system with toggle on/off
- CLEANUP: Remove original event and logging code

### Stage 8: Debug System Implementation ‚è≥ PLANNED
- Create debug namespace with domain-specific loggers
- Replace direct console logs with Debug.namespace approach
- CHECKPOINT: Verify debug toggling and verbosity controls

## Critical Technical Requirements

1. **AVOID ES MODULE SYNTAX** - Use traditional script loading
2. **Global Window Registration** - Make classes available via window object
3. **Script Loading Order** - Components must load before BattleManager.js
4. **Defensive Initialization** - Check for component availability before using

## Post-Refactoring Tasks
- Remove all toggle mechanisms
- Update documentation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Comprehensive testing with new architecture
